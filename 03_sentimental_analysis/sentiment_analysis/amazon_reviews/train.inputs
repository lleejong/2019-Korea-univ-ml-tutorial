These long cables work fine for my truck , but the quality seems a little on the shabby side . For the money I was not expecting 200 dollar snap-on jumper cables but these seem more like what you would see at a chinese knock off shop like harbor freight for 30 bucks .
They are rather small and really cheaply constructed i could have bought stuff at the store to build these cheaper they went with my old pop up trailer when i traded it in .
As soon as I plugged it in I heard a `` pop '' . No output . I guess try another inverter and probably another Cobra .
This is a small funnel , It will work for just abought any task.Small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean .
this is the cleaner and oil for kn , what more do you want ? finger will hurt after using the spray bottle , so pony up more for the regular hand sprayer or aerosol type or even put the cleaner in a hand sprayer yourself . Be innovative people..
I tried to get at the local auto parts stores , no on had in stock , thank you amazon , now my front plate and it does n't rattle any more
Noticed a big change after putting into the tranny . not the cheapest but who wants to break down on the road
Cheap , but huge ! Love it ! I will never have a vehicle without these again ! I highly recommend them . I 'm watching The Rock right now . I had to type 20 words .
Filter is one of the best , price is one of the worst in the market.When you can get one of these for 5.38 at KMart why would you even want to buy it from amazon ? I do not .
This is a common problem on all these sealers , the caps are horrible and they are basically one time use . The latest trick i have used is putting a clear wrap under the cap to help seal it but even so after time it hardens . The product itself works well and it costs a bit as you can tell compared to non cooper mix .
Friend of mine who works with leather every single day told me a few options of products in order to care my car leather seats , I pic this brand of the options he gave me .. and so far I 'm well pleased .
It would n't work for me which could of been a defective scanner . The price was good , but I was unable to reset the ECU to extinguish the check engine light .
I used this on my Burgman 650 scooter putting in speakers - major difference.This stuff real makes the area around the speakers thick giving better depth of sound ... also takes out the rattles .
This Cleaner & Red Oil are needed for the K & N Filters . Works extremely well . The purchase will do two applications covering three years for me .
Split the first time I used it and I have a 2-5/16 ball Save your money and find another manufacture for your ball covering needs .
I was expecting a better charger I could not recommend it to any one.ps it works ok but it has a cheap look to it .
Does n't work worth a darn . Regular wax works better than this product . Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand . I will go back to Turtle products from now on .
Priced right and Just right for the longer reach needed for todays cars and trucks . Buy two or 3 they are so handy.Makes it easy to fill hard to reach items such as mowers UTV 'S etc .
Installed this air filter on my 2013 Silverado and immediately realized a gain of approx . 2 MPG . Took about 10 minutes to install .
Purchased for 2010 Challenger . Installed by HyTech Audio in Houston , Texas . No road noise heard only music . Picture perfect sound .
All is good except the outlet hole is too small.It would be perfect if they made the hole bigger .
These did not fit my '08 suburban , the description said w/ 9x3 hook , so I assumed that to be included . It was n't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban .
Needed more oil for my filter and needed to get to 25 dollars for the free shipping so a win win for me
TYPICAL OF ALL OTHER MEGUIAR PRODUCTS ... ... GREAT ... ..REALLY PUTS A SHINE TO MY BOAT ... LOOKS LIKE NEW NOW ... EASY TO APPLY AND EASY TO BUFF ... .GOES A LONG WAY AS WELL ... ENOUGH TO DO MY 18 ' BOAT SEVERAL TIMES OVER ... .GOOD PROTECTION ...
This is a handy product i must say . An ALL-IN-ONE ! But the fact still remains that the power inverter does not last to one 's satisfaction . Infact , the power inverter can not fill air into a new tyre . That is only it 's disadvantage ; Power inverter does not last !
Think fly paper when you buy this item . It is very sticky which means it attracts everything . It also sticks a little too well to a dash and gets worst when it is a hot dash . Pulling it up leaves a mark on your dash for a few days . I thought it would be a friction mat , not a highly sticky mat .
First time bike left in rain this cover leaked ! Bike was soaking wet ! Do not purchase this cover ! I Just purchased the heavy duty one at twice the price will see how that one does .
Does not work as advertised . Followed the instructions , but was not able to get the headlight lens on my 2009 RV .
I 'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover , but they feel incredibly cheap and I do n't expect them to stay on while driving down the road . I understand you need to be able to take them back off , but I feel like they 're going to fall off on their own ! We 'll see how it turns out .
It was only effect with super fine scratches . With normal fine scratches , the product wo n't make them disappear . I tried to scrub fine scratches for hour but they were still there . Super fine scratches disappeared anyway . The product wo n't harm the clear coat so shiny paint coating was stay .
It may seem soft , which is is but something I do n't like about it . Nowhere to trap dirt . I love the other wool mits or the standard old school ones which work perfect . This seems like good quality but does n't have alot of soap suds and idk scared it will scratch black car .
This vehicle cleaning solution did a nice job . It effectively washed the vehicle ( dried bug guts and all ) , left very few streaks and was easy to rinse off . I see no reason to look elsewhere for another product .
I would not buy this product again . It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra .
Works OK but no better than Dawn dish soap or many other spray cleaners that are less expensive . Save your money .
The & # 34 ; KC HiLiTES 7210 Black ABS 6 & # 34 ; Stone Guard & # 34 ; fit as stated and they look good and I am thinking about buy ing another set of KC Light 's and the Covers as well . Delivery was fast and no damage to the product .
Hard to apply and very hard to take off . This will go in the back of the supply cabinet and only be useed when I am out of P21S . You definitely get what you pay for in this case .
Have used this before but was having a hard time finding it . Excellent product , the only thing you have to be careful about is not putting to much oil on after you clean it . You will have a mess every time you ride if you do . Expect a little spray going down the road but it stops soon .
This did not do much for perfomance ... the original plug works much better . I use this plug now as a back up .
It works and is much easier to lock/unlock with the key facing you than if it is pointed to the side .
No more using the penny or quarter to measure the tire tread . No more second guessing . With this gauge , you can see the actual measurement at an affordable cost . The only drawback I noticed , like some reviewers say , is it leaks oil .
Its good stuff but if you look around you can find clay for cheaper ! ! I will shop elsewhere from now on for clay ! !
I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee . It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window . It only has about 8 & # 34 ; of contact . I will not purchase this again .
I have been using mobil 1 1- 30 in my ax15 5 speed manual trans yj and it worked fine , but everyone said this is the stuff to use . I switched to it , and now the shifter is harder to engage , needs to go into first to get into reverse , just not as good as the mobil 1 and more expensive .
I bought these to haul my two kayaks . Works great . I would have given 5 stars , but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material . Also , the flag it comes with was missing my first order , Amazon sent me a new one , but the flag is real cheap ... just a piece of red thin plastic .
This is a great tool . Due to arthritis , I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely . This enabled me to insert the plug ( a replacementmetal one ) with no leaks !
what junk , scratches way too easy and was scratched when i got them , threw away , dont waste your money is you ipe or wash your car .
A little pricey for something that should have come with the license plate cover , but whatever . They snap right on the screw posts and stay put pretty well -- I have had them fall off when drying the plate with a towel , just fyi ...
does n't hang very secure to under sink door , even when I gently put bag in or out I have to hold it with my other hand worried it will come apart
One of the best things I have bought to keep the inside of my car clean and looking new . I recommend this for everyone .
People were complaining about streaks but this works just as good as my 10 year old model it replaced . The handle feels a little cheaper but I have n't had any issues . Then again my car is white and maybe any streaking is harder to see . Just be sure to leave it out on some newspaper for a few days for best results .
I bought this to do some revival on some plastics . I actually wrote a small article in a DIY Forum for Ram trucks . It looked good at first but 3 months later all the black has come off.This does n't seem to truely be a dye , more of a paint on color . I cleaned and prepped everything well and do n't believe that to be the issue .
This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates . I 'm happy . It does n't fit all cars . Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight ! !
Bought this for use as a shot glass . Real men drink out of oil filters . Are you a man ? Then get this.Oh and if you need a oil fllter for your bike ? Just go into your cupboard and grab a shot glass . It 's a win win.I have so much chest hair .
Installed to the parking lights and fender lights . Directions did n't match my vehicle . Seems like the directions were for an older model jeep wrangler . I managed to get the parking light covers on but not the fender signal covers . Need to update your information rugged ridge .
If you want a product that has been around for yrs and yrs then buy this . It will work good and cost less than others .
The idea is good , but this is not stable under my step . Each time up or down the step , it moves and there 's no way to hold it in place . I went back to my nailed together stack of 2X8s . It might work in sand though . ~Pegleg~
These things are burning our right and left . We have these installed in 8 of our patrol cars and they do n't seem to last more than a few months . Be careful if you order the KC lights with the 130 watt bulbs . The light reaches out as good as any I 've ever seen but the quality of the bulb leave much to be desired
The initial cost of these is pretty steep but the long term savings , assuming you keep cars for a few years , is quickly recovered . It adds a throating sound to your vehicle while delivering much better airflow to the engine than standard throw away filters . The every 20,000 miles or so cleaning and re-oiling are very easy to do .
either buy new light covers or deal with having dim lights . This should have a traveling carnival with it . Not worth it , would n't use product even if it was free !
I have washed these towels several times and I can not get them to stop shedding like a dog . They are wonderfully soft , thick and plush but they just keep shedding fibers like mad .
Nice stands at a nice price . I use these during the winter when I store my sports cars ; and in the Summer when I have occasion to work on them .
Pretty bad when use with a DA . Mine had a big tear even before I 'm done with my 1st car . According to Meguiars , they do n't recommend this pad with Meguiars DA G110v2
This stuff sticks surprisingly well to the underside of my carbon fiber hood . It has been a month of hard weather and it still looks and holds perfectly .
I use them and I like them ... though since they seem to be made from painted carbon steel do not let them stand in the garage floor over winter . They will most likely begin to rust . I sprayed a bit of rubberized undercoating on them to at least prevent rust for a while
Used these for my Civic speakers and bundled with the bulk pack does wonders for dampening sound and keeping out road noise ! Great purchase !
Use a 6 gal plastic gas can . Been using mine for 8 years so far .
It feels like it 's made of great quality stuff . It 's very sturdy and not flimsy like some other funnels out there . I recommended this funnel In conjunction with this item & # 34 ; RhinoGear 05068 3 piece Funnel Set & # 34 ; I use this to top off transmission fluid in vehicles . Comes in very handy ! ! !
I do not know how bright they are because they did not fit any light assembly on the car ! Uhg !
I bought a battery tender Jr & the BIG ONE , for cold weather in Pa.Cant really tell the difference , suggest the Jr unless you have specific needs .
Piece of junk . Took forever to inflate a normal car tire and broke after about 2 months . Total waste of money .
Put these on my Jeep and they throw the light a great distance . The included wiring harness is great and makes install a breeze . The lens protectors are chunky and protect well without blocking light .
Made a mistake , it 's the Detail version I wanted as they are the very best these are just ok.Get the Detail ones by Mothers and use these for petty jobs and the Detail ones for real waxing .
More for slowing down an amateur thief . Lug nuts that require a special tool are more secure . Had to grind away a bit of the shell due to interference with the wheel casting shape .
Paint was thick and didnt spray on very even at all . Was trying to tint fog lights and just didnt work .
No more using a penny to make sure my tires are safe . This little gauge does the trick . Highly recommended .
I have not read anyones reviews , but I can tell you I bought a dozen of these , what a waste I ised them on aluminum , plastic and chrome rims , and the brake dust does not disolve , loosen etc ... water and scrubbing works better . Find another product .
Meguiar 's wax is great . I use all their products . And no complaints .
Too hard to install compared with other brands.I am going to return to rain-x brand in the future even though it costs more it will save my fingers from getting bloody .
Nothing special here . Just a firm pad wrapped in cotton to apply cleaner/conditioner . It washes easily and applies well .
Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer . Very inexpensive ( cheap ) , flimsy and loose fitting . Seems like it can be broken off easily . Will probably end up getting a cable lock . This device does n't really give me a sense of security . I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for .
The valve looks good but I ended up returning it as it wouldnt work for the way I needed to hook this into my RV 's water system . Application was for a 2012 Keystone Cougar 327RES .
Eh . I have a 2005 Acura RSX and these lights look identical to the stock headlights in the car . Would n't recommend these as they do n't seem brighter or anything of the sort . Waste of money in my opinion .
I thought this company was consistant with their product value . Not only did I get plastic hooks ( that I can bend with my fingertips ) .. instead of last year 's metal hooks , I found out they lowered their price 3 bucks 2 weeks after I bought this just recently.Thanks for the lesson !
These are great mirrors ! They do not seem much bigger than the round ones but they do give a better image . Be careful about placement though because they have a tilt to them unlike the round ones you will find at your local auto store .
Great for working with metals and woods if you want a real fine and smooth finish . So get some and get sanding .
This thing is bulilt to last . I love this nozzle , it is very durable and works great . I did not have a leak for over a year now .
A could not imagine that factory manufactured item can be so much off . Sizing of the socket too loose even for 7/8 '' and completely unaceptable for 22 mm.As mentioned in other reviews oversized sockets will round the nut surface since the full force will be applied to a very small area of the edges .
I bought this produt reading the reviews in amazon.com . The product is very good but did not removed 100 % the grains of my car , but it gave a nice look .
Does what it exactly is suppose to do . One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried , the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use . Would recommend
I do n't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver . There 's a little anodized flare , and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it 's stainless steel to boot ! Nice quality item .
Bend too easy . Went to Walmart and bought heavy duty tent stakes .
The bottle does not match the picture on Amazon ... FYI My bottle rec 'd was black ... .other than that , I was pretty pleased with the product , worked well cleaning my JWT pop charger filter . ***edit*** Amazon has since updated the picture .
This thing is so Bulky and Heavy and unbalanced.. I took it out of the box and put it back . This would be good for nothing more than taking off lug nuts once a year for a rotation . There are smaller , more powerful electric impact guns on the market that you can fit inside a wheel well let alone an engine compartment .
Used this before & it cleans good . You do n't need to over do it with the oil . Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying .
Not sure why , but my this adapter doesnt light up to do the checks as it is suppose to . I think it is my suv ( Audi ) that doesnt support just the leds to verify operation . I kept it anyway as it works fine with the trailer and all the lights work .
I bought about 10 boxs for my PT . The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving , not no more . Also road sounds dimed down some . When it rains , the top of my PT does n't sound like a tin can anymore ... .
Use this for my K & N Air Filter for my Nissan Titan . Got a few more horse out because of the K & N . Oil filters good too .
I was prepared to write a & # 34 ; sham-why & # 34 ; review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber , but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up ' and began working pretty well . It wrings out easily and leaves no lint , which is pretty rad , because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy .
The oil is what you really need . The cleaner is n't anything special , at least I ca n't tell any real difference from cleaners like Fantastic . But my air filter was n't too dirty .
Clunky and heavy . I previously used microfiber towels but decided to give this mitt a try . I will be going back to the towels , this thing is clunky , heavy , and hard to remove debris from ( in the wash bucket ) . Skip it . Look into other options .
No complain , is working right and perfect . 4 stars cause it should bring a switch to turn on and off and the clam to connect to battery is week it should be stronger .I will update . let 's see how long last , I never have one .
I ordered based on product name , not size . Next time I 'll order by size . Well made , but the connection is a littke weird .
I 've read a couple reviews stating that the sizing could be wrong , so I was a little hesitant to order , but the return policy is simple so I did , very happy with my order . I can feel increased acceleration on highway speeds . I have a 2002 silverado 1500 8 cyl . rwd .
I used this products on numerous stains on my carpet . I followed the directions on the can and it removed all the old and new stains on my carpet . I will buy again !
Hard to complain , it 's a funnel , it 's a good length and width for awkwardly located fills . Has a guard on the top for spill prevention , feels sturdy and durable , and the price is more than fair . What 's not to like ?
The product description shows the size as 15x15x4 inches which is likely to be the size of the cordset when it is coiled but it tells me nothing as to the length of the cord when it is uncoiled - important information and as the seller is Amazon there is no one to phone or email to request the information .
I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis . It would not register the tire pressure accurately . It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem . I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem .
IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS JUST AS SHOWN IN THE AD . THE PRICE WAS GOOD . EVERYTHING WAS FIN AND.iT WAS EASILY READABLE ! !
Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s . Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt . Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake .
I use a lot of Mothers products but this glass cleaners is the worse . It leave streaks all over the glass . Also , when used on the inside of the glass it fogs up the glass . At night the glass fogs up so bad it becomes dangerous . I 've tried using a Microfiber and Terry cloth towel . I 've switched back to straight water to clean the glass .
It just does n't fit very well . Hard to disconnect and had a faulty connection . Typical low quality stuff from you know where . Basically , you get what you paid for . I highly do n't recommend this . Terrible product .
i used this product on a fender of a 2004 i knew it would not be a perfect match but thought it would be closer . i probably would have been almost as close looking at the colors of caps on the spray paint in walmart ! this product would be better for use in a less visible i touched up a small area under the door and that is n't bad .
What I really like about these is the locking bar . Most inexpensive stands do not have the add safety feature of a locking bar . These are quality items that make me feel very safe working under a car
this product did smooth out my hood pretty well . Not quite the results I expected but it was still a big improvement . Very easy to use/apply etc .
Although the treatment does a good job treating the windows , I have found that removal is not that easy . You have to work at removing the residual haze . I usually have to wait two days to remove the haze entirely .
I know these are tricolor , so depending on what angle you are at in front of them , they yellow is too dominant . I have very white LED fog lights and they make these headlights look like yellow fogs . They are bright enough to light up the road , but next time I 'll get a whiter bulb .
I just started using it and ordered another one today . I am a garden person with many flowers all over the place . Nozzles are important to me . This one is by far the best I 've ever used . Reaches far and many patterns that I can choose . Nothing better .
This thing did n't fit into my 2006 Honda Civic . It 's supposed to , but the frame was not trimmed correctly . The build quality is poor .
Bought these because I have a deep fear of a car falling on top of me while I 'm underneath . Although I still have a major fear of that , these things do help ease it quite a bit because of the thick and sturdy build quality and the bar thing that locks it in place . Very heavy duty stands .
I was really hoping that these would put out some good light , but I found them to provide less light than the originals .
Havent had the need for it just yet , but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though .
This is the worst piece of crap ever . I was always warned about buying the gimmicks on tv . It did n't do what it stated it would do , I did better cleaning my windows with window cleaner and a regular microfiber cloth . This was a waste of my money and time buying this piece of crap .
Fairly new battery from autozone . Brand new , it measured14v . Left the cabin light/3rd stop light on overnight by accident and battery was down to 12.7v . Still good enough , but my alternator was n't taking the battery back to 14v . Tried this tender for about 12 hours . Voltage is better . It works .
Sounded better than the OEM horn on my bike , but it only worked for a little over a year , then croaked .
Did a nice job though the clay was a bit too tacky which required more of the spray lubricant to be applied . Car looks and feels new again .
Really disappointing ! A waste of money for me ! I have a 28 ' 5'ver and all this damn thing did is put a lot of stress on my rv tire that it was on and never got the other tire off the ground . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! Go back to the old reliable way with a Jack .
First off , I could not see any benefit using this product in my toolbox . It 's a 30-day product so what 's the point ? I suggest priming and painting any metal items to prevent rust .
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot . I had to order via Amazon since I could n't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size . These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well .
Rain-X 800002243 Glass Treatment- 7 oz.It 's simple , this stuff works great when applied correctly , the rain will slide right off !
All it does is scrape and pit your battery terminals - I really do n't see the point of getting this tool . Scotch-Brite sponge would work better to clean the battery terminals .
Simple , quick review.Real , thick , stiff leather.Heat it up some to make install easier.Good color ! Feels great , works well !
Not to remove scratches , but to conceal and and make look presentable . It works well and does what it is supposed to do . Great for light scratches . Harder to use on black cars , but with a little patience it works well .
This adapter works for certain functions , such as the brakes lights and turn signals . It is missing the center pin ground needed for the running lights to work . I purchased another manufacturer 's unit elsewhere , and the system now works fine . This is a cheap , inadequate part .
The velcro that is sent with it is not very good ... on hot days in the RV they fall off and they tear easy .
i tried it on a superficial scratch , and kept rubbing the product several times , and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there , i tried it with foam pad , microfiber pad , microfiber towel , worst product meguairs produce .
But i was very impressed when I opened it and felt how sold and heavy it felt . Definitely seems much better than prior ones I have had that are likely out of China .
These are a great deal to replace stock bulbs , but if you are expecting whiter light do n't bother with these . I installed the Philip bulb in one side to compare with the stock , no difference what so ever . Trust me these are not any whiter color than stock .
I bought these cause the price seemed good.They chatter unless its pouring out I wont get them again for sure . If you want good wipers get the Rainx lattitudes or Trico Neoform they are both superior to Bosch crap..
It does a good job of regulating water pressure . I gave it a 2 star rating because the pressure gage quit after about 7 months after I got it . Called Valyerra and explained the problem . They said they would send me a new gage , that was 6 months ago . So I e-mailed them , still no response .
bought these for my k2500 suburban plenty of length front to rear . i ended up using them right out of the box as i for a dead battery in my truck . they worked great . several people have complained about the clamps . they worked well for me and i had no issues with poor connections . cables are well made .
no sure if this was a good buy , it went dead after sitting a week , recharged it up and it worked fine , need to see how long it holds a charge , i charged it work a week before i install it into bike charged with a batterytender
It did n't worked so well , a gasket was leeking , They send me a complete rebuilt parts parts fast and free . But still I had to have the purge done at the garage at the end .
I tried to be careful , so I enter my car information . Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400 . I ordered and found out it did n't fit . My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit .
2000 BMW 323i 5 speed transmission went rought instead of SMOOTH as the product claim.I flushed it 2 months after and it was dark black and smelled like VERY OLD TRANSMISSION OIL.Refilled with Royal Purple.Dont like redline .
handy little kit to keep the filters running good . simple directions and easy to clean . this is a must for anyone using these cold air filters
I use these when parking my 30 Travel trailer . They are well made and strong . They have been used probably 80 to 100 times now and , while a bit dirty and scuffed from use , they are still in great shape . They work well in securing my trailer from movement when parked .
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab . I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler ( s ) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it ! Ok , he might have a few cuts while trying ! !
great price and great amazon service , but doesnt fit the first prius ' . Be careful . refund was instant , love amazon ! 2004 and older may work for you . My ratng is not actually fair , I know . sorry
these had no effect and did nothing on the led lights I bought and on the one 's I already had very poor product I wired them up just as the instruction 's said so I had to send these and the bulbs back because they flashed to fast .
Fits and looks good . Nothing spectacular , but it helps dress up your license plate . Happy with the purchase I made .
Did not work for me , I needed a rest that will adjust back toward me , Kept them on a few weeks but took them off , unless you have really long legs They wo n't work .
so happy to receive it sooner than I thought . got very disappointed with all missing stuff in the box . manual etc .
The fender flares arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date ! The passenger side front fender has a flaw in it ! The side moldings do not fit flush against the fender flares ? The only positive is that the fenders where easy to install ! I would not recommend this product to other !
Snaps on easy , durable , has n't melted yet . It 's rated to withstand the 130 watt bulbs , so I doubt I 'll have any problems , and if so , 23 year warranty will cover it . They look nicer than bare lights , but do block and dim the lights somewhat so I 'll take them off when driving at night .
Only fair . NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer . Spend the extra $ $ $ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway ( we now use both , Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in )
This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover . While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint . If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar 's Ultimate Wax . ( paste or liquid )
I installed a custom cone cold air intake . Used this to wrap around the piping to keep the heat out , my gas mileage went up only 1mpg but thats still something . Keeps the air cooler around the piping and can definitely feel a boost in acceleration . This keeps the heat out for sure .
these are good enough to get most motorized vehicles up and running , for semi and farm equipment , get solid copper .
great little funnel , long narrow output is good for transmission fluid or other stuff similar with a small opening not easy to get to .
Needed to replace a broken mirror . This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield . It has a lock-screw to hold it in place . If you need to replace the metal holder , it is included but no glue is supplied . Overall , it is a perfectly fine basic mirror .
This wax leaves a nice shine . Compared to the Meguiars Nxt . Gen Tech wax 2.0 , they are identical as I have both.This leaves a white residue when dried so you can tell when it 's ready to buff off .
Very happy with this purchase . It is SO much better than the yellow hard plastic one . The soft rubber protects the door edges much MUCH better .
This kit seems like more of a hassle than it was worth . After using one clay bar , my car 's finish was indeed smoother , but it looked exactly the same . A few little spots of sap came out here and there , but I honestly think the same thing could 've been achieved with Goo Gone and Windex .
To thin . Ripped before the job was done . I tossed them and got a heavier glove . Do n't waste your money .
This thing will break within 5 minutes of your first use . The plastic which holds the head on is incredible thin and unable to move without the wash head flying off .
I did not like this product , other users I spoke to liked it . I found it difficult to clip together even when looking in a mirror . I would rate this as a no stars , do not buy .
It is a good quality wax , but do n't expect super shiny glossy finish from this wax . Basically it is just a cleaner wax and not anything exotic .
T.he website assured me this was a correct part for my model and year of honda . Well the sensor was right , but the connector was female rather than the needed male connector . The vendor needs to update his specs . The part was almost right , but completely wrong .
The 303 Products 30520 Convertible Fabric Top Cleaning and Care Kit is great for cleaning canvas tops . I reccomend taping off anything you dont want overspray on with the protectant as that stuff is hard to get get off after it dries
I bought these to keep from having to remove the ugly yellow smiley face ones before turning on my daylighters . They fit my 6 & # 34 ; daylighters perfectly and clip on solidly.All KC products are high quality , could not believe they give a 23 year warranty on their line of lights !
The bristles on the brush are basically strands of stiff plastic and I have not found it to do any cleaning at all around the lug nuts . Save your money .
Bought two of these for my 2003 Grand Cherokee Limited . One fit well but the other was longer . I could n't compress the piston enough to fit it , and trying to screw it in ended up snapping the metal , making it useless . I put the stock lift support back in and now I have one new and one old . It opens better but still not very good .
Good stand for the price . They hold my offroad rig at full extension on the frame no problem , and the double locking feature gives me peace of mind , but still be sure to use other safeguards .
It 's simple and effective . You easily get an accurate rating on your spark plug gap , and you can use the hole to pry the electrode open if need be . Very convenient tool to have if you 're a Do-It-Yourselfer .
Lamps did not fit as promised , should of returned them but too late now ! Did not fit the socket for the lamp on any light of the car .
Having a Harley vibration wreaks havoc on all your fasteners . Everytime i do any repair i always cllean off the old threadlocker and apply a fresh new amount . I rare if ever have to tighten down any bolts .
Best I can tell it works . When I clean a filter it 's collected a lot of junk but the cleaning solution gets it good and clean .
Never went into maintain mode after two days . Always charging and that 's when I tested with a VTVM . The battery , fully charged from use of the car , started at 13.5 VDC . Took the charger off when the voltage , at the battery , reached 14.75 VDC and was still rising . Looks nice but this one appears to be malfuncting . Returning to Amazon .
Very poorly made , I 'm going to give them 2 days before i request a refund . We 'll wait and see if they last . They were installed in my license plate and barely got them to work . Had to play around with the socket for them to fit . I'm100 % sure if I hit a bump they 'll come loose and turn off .
it looks good and good quality however description was not clear , you will need to unscrew the guter and then drill and then put back ... . i did not even try , I had one before that was snap on , much easier . this one i will not use it.sorry
This is amazing stuff . This is great stuff . Pull the filter out of my 2013 Jeep and within min it was clean . Love it .
THIS IS NOT YELLOW .IT IS CLEAR & # 60 ; NO USE FOR EXCHANGING BRAKE FLUID IN SYSTEM.I wanted yellow or blue to see exchanged fluid .Not possible with this item.Beware you wil be unable to return this can through Amazon .
Purchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus . Lasted about 7 months before it burned out . Replaced this item with NGK brand , OEM manufacturer . I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car .
When reaching for a towel to dry that vehicle - grab an Absorber . It works as good as the real thing - at a fraction of the cost ! We have a piece of one of these in the kitchen ... priceless . Do n't waste your money on Sham-Wow or other junk..get a Absorber and be satisfied .
Cleaned my filter out very easily.Can be a little messy but that 's the nature of the beast . Just plan to put some newspaper down or lean it against a fence after you spray it while its working . Brought back that new purple filter color fast.Must have for an K & N ; owner .
Dont buy this worse smell ever . Now i cant stand the smell in my truck now im stuck . With it
The price and appears to meet all our needs.Appears well made and we are happy with the sent product . Thank you .
This thing will hold a lot of water . just be sure to keep it moist inside the original tube . I will buy more of these . Just need to watch the price and buy low .
I bought three bottles , all sprayed very poorly . It came out in blotches , would not cover the tire well . I had to take a sponge to spread it evenly on the tires . The cleaning was not very good , better results with car wash suds .
Decent wax ... my car looks nice but I 'm not sure it 's worth the high price . Ca n't really say much more .
I used this product on the rear of my disc brake calibers and it was a big wasted of time.Did not push in the piston.I had to use a 6in . C-CLAMP which worked out pretty well.Lisle Disc Brake Pad Spreader LIS-24400
Admittedly I have not actually towed a trailer with this ... but it went together perfectly and I have no reason to think it will not perform just fine when I need it to . For a quality item with a well-known brand name attached , it 's an outstanding buy , and I 'm VERY pleased to have found it .
I was looking forward to brighter vision , especially on some 2-lane blacktop highways that I travel . Really disappointed with these bulbs as they do n't seem any better than the original lights in my '98 Ford F150 . In order to get better vision , I finally installed halogen driving/fog lights , and that solved the problem . I do not recommend these bulbs , not worth the extra money .
This is a must for anyone who has a K & N filter . Use cleaner to clean out filter , dry and then oil and ready to go .
The door protector is the perfect size . thick enough to protect the door even if you open too hard . Other protectors are thinner . Easy to mount . You will need to provide your own screws .
I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K & N 's product line . I have a K & N filter in all of my vehicles .
The gloves looks great . Looks like a quality built . But after using 5 times , foam paddings from the inside started to come out . Let 's see how long it will last.UPDATE ( 9/17/2013 ) Developed a hole on one of the fingers with only about a month and a half of use . Maybe about 10-15 rides . I still like the fit and feel .
Did not make it look like paint was wet i personaly use magualers . I like the wet look from that
Mine has never been used and paint chipped off . Can be a real tight fit too ( can make it work still but the foam gasket has to compress way too far ) .
I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying . I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth ... What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches ... I am sure I 'll use it , just not as much use as I 'd hoped it would get .
This will be a useful item to have around . In the past I had to carry both an 1 7/8 and a 2 5/16 ball mount in the truck . Too much iron ! Now I just change out the ball and I 'm ready .
I thought these would be better than the $ 5 ANCO ones but they are n't . They are the same at best . Save your money and buy the cheapies .
Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well , no issues . Would purchase again .
This product is simple to use on single or dual piston calipers . Just put the brake pads in and screw them out . I now do not have to use bulky spreaders anymore . If it ever breaks good luck , otc is not stamped anywhere on it though .
I was expecting more clay but I guess for the price it is okay . I have had to park my new car under trees and the paint has gotten all sorts of specs and things that appear to be imbedded in it . I hope this product works ; I have not had the time to try it out yet but only expect the best from Meguiars .
Considering this is made in China , it is a quality product , too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number
NO PROTECTION FOR LIQUID so it leaked all over the place . Was just placed in a box 20 times the size with brown paper on top . As they used UPS , and UPS does not handle with care this tends to happen . So I am out of my monies as will not allow returns on this product and it was damaged in shippment !
Works well , keeps the trailer from moving after disconnecting from the tow vehicle . These are light weight , compact , and easily stored in the basement compartment
Used a new tire glaze with these applicators . The black color from the sponge bleed onto my hands . Shape and size of the applicators required two swipes to cover the width of the tire . Just poorly designed overall . I would not purchase these again .
The rear of the meter is exposed and very sensitive to the elments . The Panel fell apart as I tried to install it . I do not understand why they do not install it into a plastic box even to be used in a panel a box would make it easier and less fragile to handle .
Works like it was intended for .
Walex TOI-91799 Porta-Pak Holding Tank Deodorizer , Not as well as I thought it should would work . Had to put several pak 's in . And yes I empty my tanks every week .
Leather tear and stitches coming out on both gloves in the inner-finger areas.Sending them back for refund . Would not recommend you purchasing them .
I use my battery tender a lot , so I just throw it in a plastic shopping bag rather then to stuff it in this little case . I ended up using this case for small parts , etc , then to store the battery tender ( that I like ! ) in it . It just needs to be a little larger .
Like others have said here this aerosol bottle makes oiling your cotton/oil filters very easy . Controlling the amount and evenness of oil is very easy .
In these cases , when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price . There are no frills here ... you pour things through this into other things ... end of story.If that 's what you 're trying to do , I highly recommend this one
better understand now what you can do ( repair ) and what not ... if you are trying to mend a tear or rip just simply forget it ...
About what you would expect , not super heavy duty but serve their purpose . i plan to pick up a few more to round out the set .
junk do n't buy
I have had experience with dynamat in the past , but had never used it on my vehicles and was a little skeptical . My car has a factory sub and the rear deck rattled like crazy . After applying this to the underside the noise is gone .
Honesty look like a toy , really is a toy.This pump is too weak and it does n't hold almost nothing .If you plan to buy , check another bigger .
The rubber is soft so my vehicle doors are protected from hitting the concrete wall . I used doubled sided adhesive tape and it holds it nice and tight . Great product !
Well ... typical of buying things on the internet , it was n't as large as it looks , but it 's still larger than what I 've bought in the past for less money ... so ... .I 'm not griping . I have a great friend in the uphostery business and he swears by it , so I use it .
I was expecting something that I could push onto my lug nuts and twist and the lug nuts would come clean , but the bristles seemed to weak ... maybe I got the wrong thing , but this is n't for me and it 's just gon na sit in my shed ...
I purchased K & N filters for my cars and this cleaner cleans filter very well . Make sure you lay filter on top of paper towels to absorb excess oil . This will keep your MAF sensor from getting dirty with K & N Oil
Great while it lasted , but does n't last long at all . Falling apart after a couple months of weekly use . Guess I will try a Microfiber mitt .
the best air filter i 'll ever owned . it 's more power to the engine the stock air filter is just thick papersK & N ; air is way better . now my car can breath better ... .the best thing is it 's reusable ! ! can you used it over and overreally worth the money . enough said ! go and get this air filter .
I bought this because it comes up when searching for a Cadillac Eldorado 1994 but this blade is too curved . It stands an inch above the window in the middle the whole way across .
This pump is not nearly as good as I was lead to believe.It leaks the car wash liquid and microfiber detergent so even after you are done , it continues to drip , making a big mess . Maybe it works better with something thicker , like a wax.I regret my purchase and would have been better off just pouring the liquids out of the container instead .
I hate these glass 's , they leak air around foam padding . Do n't like the feel of them at all . I do n't know what else to write in order to leave this comment ... .
I have a 3/4 inch hose and I was always frustated that at the end of the hose , a nozzle or a quick connect would create lots of restriction . Well , with this baby , there is plenty of water coming out ! To make your life easier and perfect use it with a full flow Gilmour quick connect.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTMGTG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00
Use this for my kc offroad lights on a mule utv . Replaced one bad bulb that would come on/off . Worked as expected . Nice and bright .
I 've had a lot of luck with LED auto bulbs off Amazon , these were the exception . I put these in my Ford Ranger and only 1 out of the 4 worked . Had to return for a refund .
This did the trick for me , needed to be able to measure tread depth and it does work , its a little confusing to begin with , but once you use it , its easy to use and very handy as well .
I returned this items because it contained lead in why in this day an age would something with lead in it still be sold ?
Ok so since Ive purchased I had a couple get really hot on me and begin to smell of burning plastic and # 2 which is also important is there not Very Bright . There Yes High Powered but with a cheaper SMD . What a shame , well lesson learned and superbrightleds is the way to go except there alittle pricey but the SMD are Very Bright and wo n't burn .
i like very thing about this product except the color . it really made jacking up my jeep easier . an when using it in the mud it didnt sinkat all really .
I used this to protect a couple of relays under the hood of my vehicle and it worked great and keep the relays cool .
Never clayed befor , but seemed to work decent enough ... I used the spray that comes with it as the lubricant , and all went well ... I never noticed the gritty feel to the car before , but once you know about it , and use this , you 'll understand ... makes it smooth like glass !
product was just as described a prefect fit easy to install a lot cheaper than part stores would buy this prouct again
This stuff dries way too fast ... stay away unless you have a Buffer Machine - Unimpressed ! Get McGuiars its soo much better .
So easy to use and turn on and off . It dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun .
Amazon said it fit a 2007 Honda Element , but the Element wiper arm is not a J hook . Amazon needs to fix their wizard ; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them .
dont buy this product , I bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing , the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn , waste of money . at least amazon let me return it broken .
These work for about a week and then cease to function the way they first did . I would not recommend them for a Jeep vehicle . I would search for a different brand .
Did't work the plugs were off set and the fuses will not plug into them . Thanks to Amazon for refunding me my purchase price because all they did was take up room in my garbage can . DO NOT BUY THESE unless you plan on throwing your money away .
this the first time that i received a package like this ... the car wax container was busted and it was all over the box . i was really disappointed . i dont know what to expect next time . such a waste ...
Good quality , but did not work in 3 inches of snow . These were fairly easy to put on , but I was hesitant that they would slip off and they did .
the lights look good they were easy to install and work great . you can light up any area you see fit
The crampbuster does not work as advertised for me . I need to keep adjusting it upward . I tried a piece of 200 grit sandpaper and roughed up the inside of the crampbuster , it did not work any better and I think I wasted my money on this one .
Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck . I like this one . Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality .
Got this for oil changes on my Victory Vision . It works well but you do have to poor slow as to not overflow the funnel . It is a good length and offered an easy tool for use with my motorcycle .
very stringy and gets everywhere . it also stains everything it touches and did not seal as well as i had hopes , still have oil leak
Sometime hard to see dial wish it was maybe more magified or even the even numbers on the guage in red might help but I do like it , checked it with a guarge and appears to be pretty accurate too ! A dial guage seems to be easier for me to read , I would grade this from a B- to an A even because it is well made .
Love all Mothers car care products . Use the clay after wash to remove any deposits in the paint , then 3M glaze to bring out the shine , followed by Mothers California Gold wax to protect and seal . Two to three times a year is all you need .
Greesy , messy , does n't spread evenly and attracts dirt . Using it to shine my tires until its gone because its worthless for anything else .
Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best
on my car 's windshield . I lost one piece while driving in the rain . I do n't know why it came off completely without warning .
I have been using Zip Wax Car Wash for a while now.Last week I decided to switched to Mothers Car Wash ; to be honestI have seen no major difference in the products ; they all do mostly the same job , cleaning grime and dirty from the paint surface without destroying the wax .
These chrome caps would not work on my plate . The license plate screws heads were larger than the plastic rings that hold the caps . I ended up using them on my motorcycle . These caps were less money at my local Harley dealer too . I 'd give them a pass next time .
Not everything promised , easily bends and losses bristles , not long enough . Not overly happy with the product and would get a longer or bigger brush .
The product I received was different from the photo on-line . Even different from the photo on the product box . I sent it back to be replaced , and I got the same , wrong product . I 'm sure I could have made it work , but I do n't like buying one item , and getting shipped something else , twice .
works well and easy to clean . great to get swirls out of my black car . I use it with meguiar 's finishing polish .
Bottles were bigger than expected ( like pledge bottle size but a little fatter ) . The box was strong and in good shape . Products came on time ( surprised with UPS lol ) . Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones . I would buy again . What you see in picture is what you get ( aside from the K and N box ) .
These blades did not last a month before I had to get new ones.I no this has been a harsh winter in NYC but the regular wiper blades lasted longer.Not recommended .
Very good finish top cost or fiberglass RV & Marine products.Goes on easy comes off clean . I have used a light weight polisherWhen doing our camper.Last for months . Good product .
This thing is great . I had another one from a different company that broke because the handle was plastic . This is wood and it feel a lot more solid . I have a black car and this takes the dust right off . Great buy ! 10 out of 10
Shoppe around a little for a motorcycle filter for my 2004 Kawasaki Mean Streak . I like Fram and have used their filters on other bikes without any problems . So I bought it . Will buy another when the time comes .
It did not fit and I returned it . I ordered a FRAM and it fit right in . Plus FRAM had a rebate .
These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15 & # 34 ; . I had some that were too large and did n't fit the curve of the tire so were n't very effective . These fit perfectly and hold extremely well . If you put a loop of rope through the hole , it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires .
The & # 34 ; feet & # 34 ; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended , the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck .
This is a relatively cheap wash mitt . There is a lot of foam padding , however the actual microfiber content is minimal and not thick or plush . There are many better , higher end microfiber towels available from dedicated detailing stores .
They work and they were at a good price , so there is not much else to say . I bought these to replace a set that I 've had for years and they were just plain worn-out . So far these appear to be a good replacement for my old set .
Installed in my IS 350 . Could have used another few square feet , but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet , spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation . Do n't forget the license plate and fuel door .
I have previously used in : 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle , 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel , and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle .
match my existing wheel chocks . A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels , otherwise would be a 5-star .
This I use to replace the transmission fluid on my Lincoln Town car . The tube is quite narrow and way back at the firewall . The long skinny tip of this funnel reaches all the way back there and fits well , preventing a real mess . Ca n't beat the price either .
I use this item . I use alot of Meguiar 's products for my detailing . You do n't need alot to make it happen , SW
So , I bought this after the tool said this would fit my car . Well , after some further research and trying to install it I found that it does n't go in my car nor does my model even take a cabin filter .
This is great for using with your vanity license plates . I highly recommend it . The star shape in the middle is easy to crack into though . All you have to do is spend 10 bucks at your local Lowe 's or Home Depot . As long as your thief is lazy , you will be fine .
THIS IS ONLY FOR A DODGE ! GOT ONE ! SENT IT BACK ! I HAVE AN AVALANCH ! There '' re page does Not give you a choice , although they say its `` custom `` fit for every vehicle . I called DeeZee manufacturing and they do Not sell these amazon so watch your choices : - )
For around 20 dollars for 2 cans of KN air filter oil this will last for a long time since you only need to recharge the filters ever 30-50 thousand miles . Shipping and handling was quick and smooth and the products were in great condition .
For almost $ 9 this is too much . I recycle my old 1 gallon milk jugs and take them to my auto store for recycling . This is much easier on the wallet since you already bought the milk .
2 of these were purchased and one arrived damaged . However , they were so flimsy that I decided these were not the solution to placing some sort of grille on the RV screen doors . Whoever makes these should be ashamed because it is a rip off and Amazon should not sell them !
Product worked great for three days . Then that was it . Seemed like a good product at first but definitely ca n't recommend .
This product restored my black trim on my bumper , fender and side door panels ! The only draw back is the bottle is small and if you have a large truck you may want to invest in another bottle .
I think it is a must when you own a Hi-Lift and your car have soft ( plastic ) bumpers.Just one suggestion , please read carefully how to operate this product because if you do n't do it you have the risk to break it as happened to one friend last weekend when we went off-road .
I do not own these , and never will for good reason.Any bulb with a blue tint to it will have significantly lower light output . It 's best just to use regular , clear ones rather than these with a blue tint to the glass .
These are just too thin to hold much removed wax and if you 're going to do the job properly , you 'll find yourself changing pads a dozen times while doing the whole car . Easier to just use some good micro-fiber towels and hand buff .
Great replacement for a rearview mirror . Big for a large car perfect size . I dont know how night mode works or whatever but for sure its just a normal rearview mirrors
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it .
The adapter does n't establish a connection with the charging system in my BMW . The Tender Jr works well when attached directly to the battery but I ca n't get this convenient cig lighter adapter to work .
Tried it on two vehicles . Needed to be reset by unplugging and or restarting my app . A bit of a pain as I was being cautious and shutting down the pickup and restarting . Also did not read fuel setting on my silverado . That did work on Doge Ram 2500 . It would be better to get a more expensive device that works and that can be updated .
Anything plastic concerns me with durability . About all I can say is it fits , looks nice , and supports our license plate . I do n't know if it could take much winter graveled road abuse but time will tell and the plate should absorb most of the shock . Works for now .
I applied this based on other users responses . It seemed to soften the leather . I will see how it goes with continued usage
This does what I hoped . Easy to install . Holds plate well . I do worry that the plastic will break over time with the temperature changes or with a slight tap from another car . This has not happened yet though . I am glad I bought it .
Its listed at water resistant but it is not water resistant.Its raining right now and I can see my motorcycle is covered in water . No protection . Nada.Great fit great looking cover for maybe dust and wind but not for rain.Plan to return and get something with real water resistant cover .
After you purchase this elbow , you are able to read the fine print , and find that it contains lead . I would rather not have lead in the connection to my fresh water system on my motor home , but I have not died yet .
works well and holds fast and steady . I am really surprised by the light weight and sturdy construction . Will buy them again for the other things i have .
Looked at a lot of lights and settled on these . They perform great and ca n't beat the warranty . Only problem I have had are they are hard to get locked down once I have them aimed .
I planned to use it in a five gallon bucket purchased from one of the two large home center chains but they slope inward toward the bottom so the insert does not sit on the bottom . Therefore it requires more than twice as much soap and water quantity to be useful .
I tought I 'm buying A brand new idem but I gues I was wrong this was priviusly used and it has marks of wearing all over it , it make me sad I fall for such a scam
Having K & N in all my cars , you got ta have it . It 's not used much , but I clean the filters every six months . Works well !
The worst blade I have ever used . I assumed the first one was defective , so Amazon replaced it . The 2nd one was just as bad . About 30 % of the blade did not contact the glass - so a huge portion of the windshield was never touched .
This is an K and N recharge kit with the Aerosol not the pour out style that works easier for the user . Great buy for less than what you would pay any where else for the same stuff . Well worth the price and shipping and receiving were simple and super fast . Thanks again Amazon .
Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car . Dont know why . Work fine on the front but not the rear . Also they are security screws , so do not lose the device that comes with them . FYI
So far I like this lock set up , I live in the Four Corners area of NM , I hope to not have the rusting problems some reviewers have had in the wet slushy climates .
I have K & N filters on all my cars and I needed this recharge kit to clean and keep my cars running smooth . This kit worked great and looking forward in keeping my air filters clean with this kit .
These things are super cool . Makes having 3 different hitches a time of your life you 'll look back at with shame .
To costly abd does n't work any better or easier than a brush anddetergent to clean the tires and rims . WOULD NOT buy again .
I have a 2004 Yellowstone sport RV . This does not fit the inside space of the vent ( the vent crank gets in the way ) . Even when I remove the crank and use the sticky tape that comes with it , it just falls off . A good idea , but a bad design . Do n't know what might make it work properly .
I have three of these and they all work just fine ! I keep them in the trunk of my cars with a tire repair kit ! They are a little noisy and rattles around a bit when inflating , but it does the job !
I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by . It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well .
I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes . It was too cheap to hassle with the return .
I have two of them now . The first one I bought about 7 years ago but it wast the tri-ball , so when I upgraded my trailer to the 2 11/16 I needed to buy a new ball ... . Or buy another one of these with the triple balls then I would have another shank to mount on another vehicle
we bought this at canadian tire and within a year or so the tire gauge split lengthwise along the seam - making it useless - as the air just leaks out the side and does n't measure the pressure ... i give it one star for lack of durability ( its not like we use it daily ... so maybe 10 uses ? )
This cleans all filth on dirty filters with ease . I need to look for a bigger bottle of this stuff
Works well on our Lexus ES350 , and a good affordable aternative to OEM . What I do n't like is the nut is spot-welded with six tiny welds to the wrench part . It 's holding up but I would rather see a continuos bead weld where the two parts meet .
Vest was well made . However , the XL size I ordered was more like a medium . I normally wear size large , so I figured I would order an X-Lg and have some extra room for winter shirts . This thing fits like a medium . Ca n't even snap it . Lucky I had a friend that wanted it .
I used it to wax my daughters car . It fell apart before I finished applying wax . Was very dissatisfied with this Meguiars product .
Ok I think this is way overpriced for the product you buying , it 's defiantly overpriced , and it 's basically just a bag and it 's not attachable to nothing so yes you can place your locking Kay in there but where can you place it if it 's not attachable to nothing
I use this on my RV and it shines great ... With something that big , I also recommend a top quality random orbital , like Griots 10765LNGCRD
Bought 2 of these for my 27 foot Jayco Bunkhouse and they seem to work great . Very well made of durable hard plastic . Camper does not move 1 inch once I have them in place ... .Go ahead and buy a few ... Kurt
fast shipping and a good price . I bought this and the cleaner separately instead of the combo kit because I think you get more for your money this way . Oil was easy to apply ( best used outside for aeration purposes ) . Never buy a air filter again .
Did n't do anything for the scratches , no impact at all ! Frankly , I am highly disappointed . Do not recommend you to buy and use this .
I bought this one which cost a bit more but I am sick of all the plastic junk and this one appears it will last forever .
They say 4100k , color temperature matches my stock 2700k bulbs ( appearance in housing and beam ) . I returned right away . The life is rated poorly too . Not woth the money for fog lights . I purchased quality LED bulbs cheaper that will last as long as I own my car .
The stem is somewhat loose and has a tendency to move in the base . l had wrap electical tape around that area to make it more stable . Therefore I 'm disappoint in this item .
You need this to keep your K & N filters in top condition , hopefully it will also work for Fram AirHog filters , as the Fram cleaner kit is much harder to find !
While this product does make it easier to get to some of the hard to reach places of the inside of a windshield , the cloth is too thin and overall to small to effectively clean .
My seats are ten years old so I cleaned the and applied this product and it soaks into the leather but does not leave a film .
This cleaner and protectant works well . The smell is a bit overwhelming but it luckily goes away after a few hours . The results so far are good . Not sure how much better this is vs less expensive products but so far less dust build up . Real test will be in spring and summer .
in the end I 'll get the aerosol oil spray . with a large filter , it 's a pain to go lubing it rib by rib with this method . It 's efficient in not wasting oil , but still a pain . good product however.the oil in here was good enough for me to lube the K & N ; in my cherokee , z06 , and harley .
This stuff didnt work at all . The intructions were a bit hard to understand , but once figured out , the product was a piece of garbage anyway . Didnt really make a difference , if anything made the problem worse .
It works but like others said , theres nothing easy about getting the old one off . Takes some patience and upper body strength to get it going . Found a similar set locally for a couple bucks less . Quick shipping .
I love this product works just how I expected to work..Dries my car faster than just using towels . So far I think it will last a while , made from good quality materials
All my cars have K & N air filter cleaning systems . I got two filters per car . I use one and clean the change out . Better gas mileage . SW
Bought this for my Subaru forester , the check said it would fit it did n't , wont waste my time sending back poor purchase
This item that I ordered twice in two different sizes . Always said it would fit my 2013 jeep wrangler sport unlimited . Never fits ! ! Says easy to install , but it does not go over the light cover . Really wanted this to work the second time . Chance the description and say does n't fit 2013 jeeps .
Been using these since the 70s.They simply works . Read the instruction.But may require frequent application , depending on the weather and wipers usage.The coating does wear out with use and by the sun
This should have posted the gauge for the wire which would help decide if it will work for you . I would recommend doing more research before purchasing .
I like this a lot better than ArmorAll . It smells nice and does n't leave any residue behind . It 's more expensive than other stuff , so I 'm not thrilled about that . If it was under $ 10 I would give it 5 stars .
Bought one for my 04 GTO , it lasted about a year and then died , sits on the charger and wo n't go above 10.5 volts . I expected better .
With 50,000 miles , my factory ISS was making noise ( like they all do ) . I put this one in with a new green bearing , and it was maybe 50 % better . Then after 2 months , it was noisier than the factory one I took out and threw away . Now its REALLY loud . This was a 100 % waste of money .
I bought these to mount on my tractors snowblower to help with visibility when it is dark out . The tractors lights are okay but do n't put out a lot of light . These light up my driveway great when I have to snowblow in the dark . Pretty good for the price .
I thought that the product would be thicker but it goes on smooth and last for a long time just rember to buff it out with a clean cloth or when it rain it will streek .
If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is , always non-functional . this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly .
I 've sent back two of these and both have failed . Talk about cheap junk do n't waist your money . I now own a Genius G3500 3.5amp and it kicks big time butt .
I got this nozzle to try a different nozzle for different reasons . You can never have enough nozzles for hoses . It works well , puts out great pressure and you feel like something is getting cleaned instead of just soaked .
It would have been a five star review . But 409 works better , on cleaning up a bike . Mother just makes the part you use it on look wet , and leaves the dirt beneath . Four stars ...
This filter combined with an Airaid MRT helped my 2004 Tahoe make a little more power and sound like it has a V8 under the hood ! The filter fit nicely and should provide plenty of filtration for this daily driver .
I liked the absorber because it did not leave any streaks on my vehicle . The material was sturdy and not flimsy .
I bought this as a extra , so that when I change the oil I will have a new one . It look to be of great quality and I am sure it will work just fine .
would not stay in place . ever one who used it pushed it the wrong way & had to be reset each time it was used . better off with out it ... .
Do n't buy this unit . Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead . This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it 's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain ...
THE JACK STANDS FELL WITH NOTHING ON THEM WHEN I BARELY SHOOK THEM . MADE IN CHINA JUNK . WASTE OF TIME . IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE BUY AMERICAN JACK STANDS .
I took a flier on this after reading the reviews . I lost . The meter is easily 5-9 volts off ( tested with my multimeter and confirmed with my volt meter app on my power supply ) .Do n't waste your money . Amazon should seriously consider dropping this item from its website .
This is a must have for those with excellent water pressure and volume and a good hose . I highly recommend this .
The mitt is okay but too thin.It feels like a thin towel when you use it to wash your car.And the mitt is too big . My hand was moving all over inside of it.Mitt was okay but material wayyyy tooo thin . Needs to be much thicker if it wants to do the job right.Better off getting a microfiber towel or sponge than this .
This product is added to the black tank only when we are traveling in an attempt to control the `` morning startup slosh odors .
I musta spent a gazillion dollars on nozzles from wally world , k-notsmart , etc . I just wish I had bought one of these in the first place ! I heard about it from a friend who owns several aircraft and he says it 's the best for use around aircraft . I figure if it 's good enough for his airplanes , it 's good enough for me ! Love it !
Returned this . Fit was ... okay ... . but with only flimsy magnets to hold it in place , there was no way it was going to stay put in a 50-60 mph wind . I was n't willing to risk it .
No issues , just as described , Used to cover spare tire on boat trailer . Good quality . Currently have owned for more than 6 months and looks like new .
It is hard to apply films your self . Might be better to let the professional do it . I gave up after while
This is my second one of these . I have been using K & N products on my cars for about 10 years and this kit cleans them well . I usually clean my filter every 25,000 miles or so . The kit lasts about 3 or 4 cleanings .
They keep the contacts clean and lubricated however they are both the same and not a matched pair for vehicle and trailer .
I thought these were great because they worked great at first , but it was n't long until they started streaking ( just a few months I believe ) . The streaking was very noticeable and annoying .
This thing leaks on first use . The hoses are not tight and the brake fluids leak everywhere under my hood . Lucky I put 3 towels around the brake fluid tank because I knew this would happen . Will not buy this again .
After using this clay I just assumed clay was a pain to use . But after trying a different brand I know better . This clay falls apart while trying to use it ! It also is a very mild clay which is n't a bad thing , but if you want better results , I recommend another brand .
Does a good job , however , I probably will not buy aging . Smell is nauseating . Does not last too long . Did bring back the black and looked ok . Dirt stuck to well after 1 light application and let dry .
They whistle while they work ! But only sometimes ( whistle that is ) . I only use them a couple times a year on an Expedition , economical .
This stuff works great and the price and shipping were all excellent . I ended up thinking one roll would work on a F250 front door , nope . It took nearly two rolls , so I had to order more , but that 's okay , I did .
worked fine ... went on with no problems and I like the price much better than the cycle shop 's price ... next time for sure
never got it to work , no help or support with software , so i sent it back to get my money back , they should not sell crap that dont work .
bestop has always been good quality merchandise.this product is no exception.very good quality fit and well constructed.make sure you know your tire size so you get the right fitment .
Pump works great but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired . I should have realized that the cc volume it delivers per pump was going to take forever to empty a quart of fluid . Live and learn . I will still use it , but only when all else fails .
save your money . cheap plastic stuff that wont work . it wont stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to . falls off blows off .
Did n't realize I already had the puller I needed , but it 's a good kit to take apart a front end with little or no damage of the seals on the TRE'sGood kit to have ... ...
I ordered this before I was aware of Pri-G . I understand Sea Foam is much better than Sta-bil but not as good as Pri-G. Pri-g is MUCH more concentrated and therefore represents a better value . It is what I will be ordering in the future .
Use this product to recharge your K & N air filter . I do n't know of any other product I could use to recharge my filter .
This kit is impossible to use and is not worth the money . Regular vinyl stick decals are easier to apply . The fact that this kit comes with wet sand paper indicates that it is difficult to use and may cause damage to the paint surface .
fell off almost immediately -- - but it was cheap so no big loss ... only someone anal as me would think the small lic plate screws need covering : )
have this permanently hooked up to my car battery . when car sits long time , I just plug it in and works perfect . have 1 for each car , never fails .
I bought this thinking it was the wash product . Was going to return it but did not . I use it but it does not seem to shine any better than a duster or clean towel .
Perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase.. This funnel can be used for other purposes of course , .. but I bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase .
... fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect . Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight . The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little .
Happy with it so far . Wife likes it . I keep one for a spare in the car in case of bad weather .
I do n't understand why but the two brushes I got were terrible . I used them to wash the small crevasse 's on my motorcycle . The problem was the fact that the brushes would n't go back to their straight position . As I would move them back and forth , the brushes would just follow . It reminded me of a severally bad tooth brush .
Lazy As . Husband would n't put it on Kawasaki bike , have cruise control on Harley Davidson Full Dream Dresser ! ! ! So i do n't know what to do with it .
Need 2 for each side , works well for small pop up . Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope , same choke . These already have the hole for rope . Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two , they are exactly the same size .
I really was n't impressed with the overall result of this Polish , as part of the Mother 's 3-step kit . I used all 3 steps , and still think I get better results from Tech Wax .
I wanted a stand with the double lock and this is it . Have been using it since purchase and have had no issues . Great value .
I should have returned this . It 's no strobe light . The Inductive Timing light is so much easier , at least where you have battery power . Its made well but be sure to have the device fully inserted into the wires . Mine fell on the floor for not double checking the wire attachments and it could have damage it .
I bought this for the wrong Jeep so I returned it anyway , but it seemed very flimsy to me . A screwdriver could easily get this mechanism open .
This is no better than scotch tape . I thought it was going to be a flexible fabric type product . Instead it is like a plastic tape that does n't stay stuck . I do not recommend this product . It 's a waste of money .
This is perfect for those times when you are not able to reach the small handle on your camper from the manufacturer or have someone that has a hard time using the stairs . It is really easy to install and even easier to use . A great product .
I put it on the first night and the bands ripped out of place . I had to rig it up to get it to stay in place . It bunched in the corners because there was too much material . But it does its job .
The tool worked great on the first set of pads . Went to do the other side and the threaded rod broke loose from the knob . NOT recommended .
This works on par with mothers showtime spray lubricant and as final once over the car so it 's perfect . Good for using as a pad lubricant when cutting , polishing , and waxing .
the first time I used it out of the box , one stand 's neck is broken . I decided this brand is the one I should avoid . And let my friend know it .
its seems to be ok but the construction of it seems to be cheap but I do n't work on cars for a living ( Backyard Mechanic )
It works but the fittings wo n't fit inside my 4 & # 34 ; square bumper . The Valterra brand does fit . So there . ~Pegleg~
garbage product , i spraied it well until the can became empty , i have stuck brake dust just after 3 days of driving , so the commercial is ? ? ? ? ? ? ? .
i used it on my windshield and bathroom shower door.it works for like a week . for the amount of time it took to apply and polish off , it should last longer.make sure to wear a filter when applying indoors . this stuff stinks .
Left auto windows streaking had to really wipe on it , I was surprised used other products from griot 's and they were great ! Will not buy again
I used Royal Purple Synthetic in my last Truck for a few years until they started asking arms , legs and first born children for the oil . I did my homework and started reading reports of independent lab 's testing . I found out that Royal Purple ranks below Mobil 1 and Amsoil . I switched to the best oil made , Amsoil , and never looked back .
The plastic was broken when I received it . Does n't appear to affect function or fit of the filter though , so it is in my car today .
this is not what i ordered or even close . does not look the same in color shape or size . buyer beware
This is such a useful tool when doing brake jobs . Simply place the tabs in between the pads and twist to push the pistons back . There is no need for positioning a C clamp or using vice grips and an extra set of hand to squeeze the pistons back .
For idiots that think you can wrap headers with this , your a fool . This a insulin . keeps heat away not keep it . put on anything to keep the heat away from wires , intake pipes etc . works great . keep your intake cool and your good to go !
great brush but it wo n't last very long - shows significant wear and tear after a few uses on my SUV 's wheels - some of the polyester bristle is falling out already - will not buy again
Super light weight , that 's why the 2 stars . Some people would like how light they are but not me , I 'd think if you crashed the road would chew these up like it was nothing . So ill save my feet and get some real thick boots
lights work but not as bright as I would liked them to be . nice for an area where you only need a little bit of light
I have to untie the hooks from the net every single time that I remove it from the seat . It is not rigid like other brands .
They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use . With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer .
We have these on the awning of our RV . The metal portion rusted the first season we use them . Would not buy replacements .
Cheap and quick fix for those of you with aging pullstraps . Ours were literally falling apart . Sliding out the old and in with the new took seconds .
I read the directions fully before starting the work , followed them completely , and I ended up with a scratched lens after using the sandpaper . I used plenty of liquid as well in case anyone thinks I put dry sand paper to a dry lens . I would definitely not recommend using this product .
It would serve it 's purpose if the on/off knob was a lever or the neck was longer . I ca n't put it far enough into the filler tube to do any good . This may an isolated case , but it did n't work for me .
These are not good . I bought them for a fifth wheel landing gear pad and they are slippery and small . My landing gear almost slipped off one of them ! I would not buy again . I went back to good old pre-cut wood blocks and am glad I did . Do n't waste your money on these junky pads .
I ca n't say enough about the quality and benefit of rain-x for treatment on my windshields . my cars and bikes love it .
This polish works very well . Mothers is a great brand and have not had any issues with any of there products . Using this polish is simple and very effective . It will make metals look brand new when you spend the time to get down into the crevices.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a good polish .
I bought a pair of these for my travel trailer . They fit fine and snug up nicely with the tire . While having a lanyard for them sounds tempting , I hate having extraneous parts on my chocks , so I like their simplicity .
A nice item to keep in your tool box . Keeps the guess work out , when checking your vehicle tires for wear .
on the advice of miles ( you know who he is ! ) use this to maintain the grille and surfaces of our kerosene heater . initial and seasonal . seems to do the trick.also there 's a kinda nice coconut smell .
Reviewer 's car : Hyundai Veloster TurboI did not have any problems with these jack stands . However , the lock is very easy to remove , so be aware of that . It did gave my car the support it needed , which these jack stands promised .
It 's a bit flimsy , the wires that loop around are thin and will bend easy . The fuzzy part is also a thin low-count bristle , and does n't really seem to dig in and clean . Good handle though .
Save your money , these things are worthless . They are very weak and flimsy and do nothing to secure anything . I would not buy again .
I returned these due to them not working on my trailer it has side skirts on it and it was impossible to use these even turned upside down Sending back and ordering standard wheel chocks .
works great ... .you do not have to use your wipers as much ... water rolls right off
I would not recommend to buy this at all . It is very slippery and not useful for holding the jack in place . I do not know why they would sale such unsafe product . Lawyer should make a case out of this product .
ca n't use this because the step on my camper is close to the ground and the adjustment is n't short enough to work on level ground . maybe it would be great on uneven ground , but what camp ground is that uneven ? how about a shorter one ?
Personally I love the spray can vs other bottle . Have used this set for years and i love it.Sometimes i worry about it being too wet ..
Installted this horn kit on my wife 's truck after my son installed small car horn in it ( beep beep ) . Now her truck sounds like a truck should and is plenty loud . I wish the low frequency horn had a lower frequency , but it is acceptable .
Terrible quality . These towels leave behind tons of lint and immediately began to become threadbare . After only a few months and limited use most of these towels are destroyed .
The unique locking pin makes these worthwhile . However , when you read the instructions , it 's not clear how to bend the `` tab '' to hold the supports in the frame . Best way is to take a big screwdriver and bend them inward . Ca n't believe they do n't put that on the instructions , since it 's not intuitive .
Product is as described . Good sealant , used it to strengthen the seal around an oil pan heater pad . The truck goes through automatic wash bay weekly and I have not had any issues with seal failure causing water to fry the pad .
I had a time trying to keep the connections from leaking . As you tighten the connector on it would torque the hose and it would unwind and loosen the connector causing a leak . I ended up putting a pressure regulator on that had a rotating connector . It allowed the hose to untorque itself without unscrewing the connector .
This stuff has n't changed.The forumla and process has been around for ages , and works the same each time.My motorcyles air filter is very exposed due to the hypercharger , and it needed cleaned stat.Ordered this kit and washed , cleaned , oiled , and dried to perfection.Order yours today !
For the pump : -Solid construction.-No problem loading the grease tube.-Gives out good pressure for injection of grease.For the coupling : -Had a real hard time pulling the coupling away from the zerg fitting.-I would replace the coupling .
Yea its good wax for the money and gives your car the protection your car needs . Reason why I say that is , I go by how it beads up when it rain . NOW having said that I waxed my car 1 month ago , I will see how long the shine and the beading lasts . If not just move on and try a different product .
Rubber is way to soft they all 4 tore within three days . Need to be made of neopreme or something stronger . wo n't buy again
Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful , but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator ( 26 ft vehicle , decent sized refrigerator ) . I do n't use this , as it is too large , and use the single bars instead . They work well .
I 'm using this to protect the cutout of our new granite countertop from the heat generated by the cooktop . This material feels heavy and professional , so it looks like it will do the job nicely . The adhesive sticks fine so far .
These are not HID like , they are not even ID without the HThey are not whiter , not brighter and not even better than stock.DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THESEThe other ratings you read here must have been paid for .Move on and do n't buy these .I just save you 30+ bucks .
After 1.5 months in the sun it ROTTED out . Not made for outside awnings as advertized . DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK !
So I wanted to add a battery disconnect to my RV batteries and ordered this . But when It came time to actually put this on I was not impressed . Battery cable wire size was to big for the switch . Would have been better to see prior to purchase .
This item shipped defective . Parts not covered with chrome are rusting . This is usually a good product , I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem . I need to have these two plates replaced .
I love this funnel more than others that I have because it is the only one that stays in while I am pouring . The long spout keeps it in . I highly recommend it . I use one for automotive and my wife uses one for pouring in the homemade detergent into barrels .
I have been watching these for a while . Came in at Wally World , little over half price.I have used them for years but they DO have an Expiration Date on them ... Safety in case they dry out ! Excellent for Wheel Chocks in the Garage Too . It grips the concrete and Larger Tires very well . `` BatmanDSM ''
This did n't do what I need it to which was to remove glue from my paint car . I even heated the remnants of glue and still did n't work . I 'm disappointed .
I have several of this , I use them for all sorts of things . They last for many years , I use them on job sites to keep cool , just dip it in cold water and instant cooling.We also use them for keeping the dogs cool as if they were n't already cool looking.DO NOT BUY ANY IMITATION This is the best !
Torin T43002A 3 ton double locking jack stands . I know of other individuals that have use these and I decided that I needed them too
I 'm using it on thy 38 ' 5th wheel and it 's working fantastic . Goes on very easy and comes off the same way . Buffs up to a bright shine that 's silky smooth to the touch . You ca n't go wrong with this product . I 'm buying another bottle right a way .
I ordered this for a 2008 Honda Civic.This valve will not screw into the oil pan , because the spot where the plug is located is recessed , and the valve ca n't turn in that space .
This was exactly what I needed for transporting my fishing kayak in the bed of my F-150 . Easy to assemble and works great !
Looks cheap . The hooks sit out too far , so I do n't feel comfortable leaving them hanging in the car ... I do n't want someone to accidentally snag themselves or hit their face on this in the back seat ... especially with a child in the back .
Just installed the lock on my trailer nose mounted spare tire . After installing , it obviously works as described in the ad description . So far , I am satisfied with the item .
it works as it says . Hooked it up on the bike for a long distance 12V connection on travels and head phones .
These tools paid for them selves with the first use . Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems . Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10 . I will never touch a pickel fork again !
Got the shine back on my 13 year-old original paint . Easy to use and a little goes a long way . Works better if you have orbital buffer . I used a electric screw driver and even made my headlights sparkle !
Nothing spectacular . They work , they are as advertised , and they are a good value . The cables have a strange `` feel '' to them that will leave a residue on your hands .
It is hard to find pure copper cabled jumper cables . The add for these gave me the confidence that I was getting just that . After arrival I noticed the plated copped aluminum wire : ( . Not a deal breaker as they are well built and will most likely do what I request of them .
A dollar ? I stole this . hehehee
Good way to cover those vulnerable connectors for my trailer . Works perfectly for the 4-pole connector and should keep problems away .
You just do n't expect these to be made of hard plastic and so small . But then you look at the price and kick yourself for expecting more . They work , but I highly doubt they 'll still be around in 10 years .
These Camco RV Wheel Chocks are heavy grade injection molded plastic and work well to secure my 5'x10 ' enclosed trailer in place . These have ridges on the bottom and where it contacts the wheels , which adds extra gripping ability.We picked up four of these Wheel Chocks locally for a little bit less than offered on Amazon.Highly Recommended ! CFH
I ordered an XL pair of these gloves . However , they barely fit my wife 's hands and she is all of 5'2 & # 34 ; and has small hands.The package and the gloves were clearly labeled XL . Poor quality control at the manufacturing plant somewhere . The quality of the product itself seemed to be adequate but unfortunately I could not even try them on .
I USED 3 CANS OF THIS LOW GRADE JUNK CLEARCOAT AFTER APPLYING THE BASECOAT . IT WAS LIKE GLASS WHEN APPLYING AND FINISHED..2 HRS LATER IT WAS LIKE A SATIN FINISH LOOK..A DULL SHINE..CALLED DUPLICOLOR FOR A REFUND..STILL WAITING..THEY BLOW ! !
Works like crap . Does not allow enough air in to blow lines out . Save your money and use an air nozzle instead . Trust me !
I am disappointed with the Valeo wipers . They were expensive and have failed to deliver better performance than the cheaper wipers . In fact , they began to streak noticibly on two of the three vehicles that I installed them on , after only one month of use . Do n't waste your money ; get the cheaper wipers and refils ...
this scanner works just like they say you have everything you need to scan your auto . WORTH EVERY PENNY ! !
I have a black car so i need to dry it to avoid spots . this works great . holds a lot of water and takes me few min to dry whole car .
I like this product and would buy it again and again , very well made and saved me a lot of money .
Will continue to keep ths stuff in the garage . Cleans great , smells great , leaves no residue behind , and seems to keep dust from attracting to the dash .
they work - and increase the volume of blast from my bike - but be prepared to sort out the wiring on your own ...
OK product , did n't fit my grips.. I guess only made for their grips .
Find a good dye and perfume-free detergent and wash your towels in it . This stuff seemed to work ok on my foam polishing pads , but I was able to achieve the same if not better results by using 409 . I do n't see any difference at all in using this to wash my microfiber stuff .
I was looking for a nice towel and after read these reviews I was convinced to buy this product . Im disappointed because im Meguiars fans and I was sure that would be a nice product . Its does not abborb the water as announced .
This is not a replacement for the amazing griots garage one , but its also a 5th of the price . Works well , takes abuse and seems built to last .
You could find something suitable at many retailers . I thought it would be a heavier . It 's like that stuff you use to keep things from sliding in your droors ! Oh yeah , and it drives me nuts in the wind slapping the roof !
I love this product and it works great ; however , my only problem is that the detail spray is barely enough for a mid-sized sedan . That being said , It works great ! I would have given 5 stars if there was twice as much detail spray .
Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door . ( 2005 Ford F150 ) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it 's a very fast job .
i really like this lil thing ! it is well made and very useful for a lot of applications ! hi lift are making great kit these days just seem to be really over priced ... ... ..
Battery test lights quit working after after two or three times using it.Do n't waste your $ $
Pulled my Jeep out of a puddle with a moderate tug and it has begun to fray after one use . Looks like it will be around for a little longer , but I did n't expect that to happen .
this is a wallpaper seam roller . i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks . u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store . im sure this roller does work , but 13 bucks is crazy . i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going .
Way too expensive for a such low quality product i justgong to use my regular product thus dont order this
This is my first purchase of rain-x . It seems to work pretty well . I do wish it lasted longer . A few weeks after application it seems to be wearing off unevenly . Also it was difficult to get a good buffing on the windshield after the first application . Once it rained the wipers seemed to even it out though .
This bulb does not emit the light I was hoping for . I suppose if I had more experience with LED I could have picked a better bulb .
Bought a few years ago ; lasted 2 years with perhaps 1 use every 2 months.Save your money and shop around via Internet on a more reliable compressor : e.g , Camp.Haus. , or others .
These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles.Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work . I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money
i used it to insulate my headlight on my motorcycle ! ( i put in an hid light ) not the most flexible stuff but can be cut up and set nicely !
I bought this to put on all my bolts on my saiga 5.45x39 project every thing holds strong.I recommend this product for any one doing small projects and do n't want screws coming apart .
Based on some forum posts , I originally bought this product to use soley on wheels to reduce brake dust build-up . Although it was okay for these purposes , I thought I would try it on the whole car . I was not disappointed- easy to apply and good durability .
Hi lift lives up to the name still , and at first i was sceptical , the packing was ify and it didnt seem to solid , but regardless had to test it out attached to my jack , and it lifted my jeep no problem .
Good price and decent amount for small projects . Would recommend to others and also recommend others to wear gloves when handling this .
I looked around for a better price but Amazon had the best number ! I have one in both cars and soon as I get time I will be building a K & N set-up for my other vehicle as there is not one made for it
Do n't waste your money on these bulbs . I installed them in my Grand Prix and saw no improvement , just a dent in my wallet . Do n't fall into the hype like I did .
Since Griots makes you buy this separately I thought it would be a good product . Not so . This sprayer didn`t make it through half the bottle when the seals broke . The speed shine is a great product , but the sprayer is crap . Save your money and just pour the speed shine in an empty Windex bottle like I had to do .
I bought this polish for long time . when open the bottle it comes a blue creamy liquid , it show as its description how the shinny it was and easy to clean up . I compare to Mother 's product , it looks with similar result but much less in price . Anyhow , it works as it is .
Do Not waste your money . Bough a mid grade & # 34 ; full size & # 34 ; digital gauge and found this one to be off by 5lbs !
why sell a product that the buyer has to purchase better velcro to make it stick ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? This is absolutely ridiculous ! It would be an easy fix for the manufacturer to LISTEN to the customer complaints about this product and require better velcro glue .
I had this thing for a few months and it worked really well for taking off oil filters . It only made it through like 3 or 4 filters until the spring broke though . I do n't recommend buying it .
Fairly easy to apply and works really well . Have never used any other glass treatment to compare it againsts but this does the job .
Product was shipped and received in short order as advertised . Its a thick chunk of plastic that is reinforced with ribbing . Should hold up fairly well in conjunction with the Hi-Lift jack .
I love putting the top down in my convertible during the fall and even well into the winter . This blanket keeps my girlfriend nice and toasty while we enjoy the drive . The cord is long enough to reach the back seat from the front outlet and the blanket itself is big enough for two people .
Broke quickly after first usage and when it did work for a little while the readings were off compared to two other guages I own- a Slime and a craftsman digital so it was definitely defective then it just quit reading after a month of VERY light usage . Unhappy is an understatement and hopefully these folks read these reviews and re-design this product . Quite unhappy .
This is a piece of junk. ! The straps stretch , the plastic clips slip off while tightening , and the dam things fall off while driving . Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on . They do work well .
I wish the tool was about an inch longer . For a 1995 VW Jetta , with the tie rod inserted , I ca n't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short . It 's still usable but the wrench part wo n't clip in place so there 's a lot more fumbling around .
I have a filter in my car and my wife 's car - this cleans them perfectly and is so much easier to spray than the bottle that came with the original cleaning kit .
This is just what I was looking for , perfect size for the spare on my 90 4runner . Looped it through the spaces in the wheel and locked in the back . Nice for the added security .
Been using K & N filters and this service kit for years . Best way to save money on air filters . Buy this as soon as you get your car and you will never need another filter again .
I bought this thinking I wanted very accurate gauge . One it is very hard to couple to the Schrader valve to you I have found the accuracy to be questionable compared to other gauges .
This is smaller then I thought for a funnel , yet it is useful more then I thought it would be . Such as oil in the lawnmowers .
I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job , returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter , good to go !
Works somewhat but the clips that hold the brace up broke off . A little quality control would go a long way .
I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle . I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons .
No luck with this Meguiars product , Its does just okay when drying the paint after I wash my car but the glass is another sad story
A little pricy for the spray but it does what it is supposed to do well and instead of throwing out filters you can reuse them a few times depending on the condition . I normally clean it two times than toss it out .
It cleans all the K & N filter products nicely and restores them to a like new luster . Have yet to clean my 6 month old filter in my Civic Si , have used it regularly on the YZ250F
got four of these and two of them dont work , sending them back . i would buy them somewhere else , these are very short and not that bright anyway .
It was way too small for an adult head . After testing it a couple of times , I started getting dizzy and not sure whether it was the fumes I was smelling when the mask was tight close to my nose . Anyway , I simple can not rate this any higher not because of the small size but more about the odor/fumes .
Found this dangerous for my 29 ' Airstream . It 's fine for level parking , but do n't use this on sloping grades . Trust me on this one . For smaller , lighter campers I 'm sure this would be ideal .
These wipers are noisy and leave streaks . I could tell they were n't well made right when I took them out of the package . You get what you pay for .
Takes the dust off my car without leaving any streaking that some report with other brands . Just do n't press real hard .
I loved these for my Honda Odyssey minivan . Easy to use and install . Very well built . I would easily recommend these !
I could not rate this product as it opened up in shipment and the bottle was completly empty . I was sure glad it was wrapped in another plastic bag , which held about 1/2 of the liquid . The rest was aborbed by the over sized back it was ship in .
I decided I needed a new seal puller and picked this up cheap here on Amazon . I tried to pull two seals with it today and it just tore through them like a can opener . It would have been easier to use a hammer and a chisel .
I tried installing this but found that the stairs on my trailer have a support bar through the middle and there is not a good place to install it . ( I should have read the reviews and would not have even ordered it ! ) I will wait until I get home to my shop and make some modifications so I can use it .
Ordered several funnels . One for my Auto trans oil . One for filling the Toyota van anti-freeze via the top hose . Faster than filling via the radiator cap . One for the shampoo consolidation in the house .
I could n't even get my fingers in . I normally wear Large so I ordered XL and ca n't even get my fingers half way in . I have the Raider full motorcycle gloves and they as well as these are a good deal when they fit.I JUST WISH THEY WERE HONEST ABOUT THE SIZING AND QUIT WASTING BUYERS TIME . IT 'S A CRAP SHOOT GETTING A PAIR TO FIT .
First of all , the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car 's motor . Secondly , the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable .
Very cheap blade , mine started chattering in 1 week and I returned them . Buy a quality Motorcraft ( or similar blade ) Amazon has the best customer service and took them back ...
I bought these to use when parking our travel trailer and did not want to spend a fortune for something that does such a simple basic job . These do what they are supposed to do , appear to be solidly built and durable , and do not add a lot of weight while hauling them around . They also do n't take up much storage space .
These fit perfectly on my tires but the straps that go around to hold them in place were not easy to connect . I had to climb under the 5th wheel to connect the buckles . Normally this would not be a problem except I park the RV in a gravel lot . Just be aware of how they secure on the back side .
Yeah , it says it but do n't try to tint anything on your car or you will get pulled over , trust me .
Difficult to apply and gooey . Made a mess . After I am done using this up I will be going back to my spray from Meguiar which is great and lasts .
It ca n't be magic to fix the problem right the way . It takes a little bit of mileage before it can solve out the problem . I treat it as a piece of tylenol . Its OK .
I used this product about an hour ago . The foam is much to soft and will not reach the areas it should . It does not polish well at all . Grab your rags , polish , tin foil , and a can of elbow grease , do it by hand and you will be a lot happier .
These relays arent the best in the world . I purchased 2 , one for my reg headlights and one for my fogs . One out of the two was bad before I even got it in my car . The other one went out 3 months down the line . Had to purchase some nicer more expensive ones so my lights turn on .
I have used this product in ( 3 ) vehicles , ( 2 ) lawn mowers , ( 1 ) grass trimmer , ( 1 ) snowblower and a partridge in a pear tree . I have n't noticed any benefit in using this product whatsoever . For fuel storage , I would recommend STA-BIL 360 .
Cover fits well with their screw . They should 've sell it as package . Nonetheless , perfect match and my car is now ad free .
This is only fair . The clip mechanism does not hold well to a valve stem and must be frequently readjusted .
Not good for cleaning tubs . I believe the description said it would work on tubs/bathrooms . This took a lot of elbow grease to do anything . I ended up using theDico 541-786-21/2 Nyalox Cup Brush 21/2-Inch Blue 240 Grit which worked great .
received open box . looked like everything thrown in the box . neither lights worked . so all these good reviews trying again
I have an 11 year old chevy pickup which we use on the ranch and the finish on the truck gets abused on a regular basis . I waxed the truck a couple of months ago and the rain water still beads and the dirt easily comes off now when I wash the truck .
I wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the Beast up while I scurry about underneath . These fit the billl . The safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look OK to my untrained eye .
yes , they are wire leads with alligator clips , so if that 's your only standard for giving them a good rating ... otherwise , trying to use these as jumper wires in electrical work is useless since they have so much resistance due to the very small gauge wire and shoddy connections . they make good clips for hanging paper , lol
Was hoping they would fit into my BMW e46 and save me $ 40 , but they were 1 & # 34 ; too short . on the drivers side long one . they were almost there ... why wo n't anyone make a refill that fits my BMW you 'd sell a boat load .
When I ordered this , I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine . When it arrived , it was not the correct size . i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store , however , I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in .
These things slip on a hard painted concrete floor . Possibly OK on asphalt , but not concrete . Pass on them , get something else .
This works perfectly and sets my mind at ease with all the light fingered individuals out there ready to lift your battery , propane tank and whatever else they can get their hands on..
This cap was not good for my vehicle , the truck emission light came on which means the gas cap is not good and did not seal good .
Works very well for the cost , I would recommend an attached rope to allow for easier removal from the wheels .
I bought 4 of these to change the rear shocks on my S2000 . They work as advertised .
Ugly , heavy , uncomfortable and hot . There is really nothing good to say about this jacket . Save your money and order something else .
Fifty cents wort of tubing and a nipple . This is a joke . It now resides in a zip-lock bag in a lower drawer of my tool box , never to see the light of day again .
I bought this stuff and it did n't clean anything off my chrome rims . Worthless crap . would n't mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop .
I 'm one of those guys who stops and helps people when they need it . While not a pro recovery guy I use my cables more than the average person . These fit the bill just right . Strong clamps with a long cable that stays pliable in the cold .
Having used other Klasse products , I recently bought this for my daily driver . The instructions caution you to use the product sparingly- too much and it 's difficult to remove . Just wipe the excess with a damp cloth . Despite this challenge , it left a nice durable shine .
Found the same 4 pack at Walmart for $ 2 less . I think Amazon is padding prices to make up for free shipping.As far as the product goes . Very thin typical RV paper your finger will go through eventually . Have soap and sanitizer ready . 4 Sheets equal one square of Charmin .
I have a ~7000 GVWR travel trailer and bought two of these . One stops the wheels from rolling in one direction . That 's their job right ... and for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes , it 's just unbeatable . If you 've got to stop something , chock it .
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works . I have never been able to get it work at all . I have tried every possible method and no luck . I understand how gravity works but apparently this device does n't . If you get it to work , more power to you .
These were easy to break and they did not fit my 2008 Honda Civic . The description of the product needs to be changed so people do n't end up buying this and it does n't fit their vehicle .
I use these very often . Helps me feel a lot safer when under my truck . They adjust well enough to get under there without much jacking up and jacking down .
Taking a chance on this product . Had to repair a size able hole in one of my pipes . It just has to hold about 10 days until the replacement part arrives . Been about 5 days now so I may make it . Satisfied with this as I did n't expect it would last this long !
After 200-300 miles i realized i had a leak from under my SV1000S . after investigation it was the o-ring that was dry rotted . no telling how long this thing sat on the shelf before it was sent to me . I guess this is a problem that could have happened when buying it from a local store but nonetheless frustrating
One of these under my bottom step ai n't getting it , I am going to buy another one and put them on each end , one only keeps moving around . Well made , good quality unit .
I bought this pump because the seller described it as a siphon pump and I wanted to drain the gas out of my boat 's gas tank.What I got , was a gas pump that does not siphon gas.I guess it might work for filling a lawn mower from a gas can.It is cheap and worth about five dollars .
Not near as bright as others I 've seen , the original incandescent light assembly was a lot brighter.The gaskets does not fit snuggly in the hole opening allowing the light to just sit loose in it , it would eventually fall out . I was able to use my original gasket but again the brightness is the main issue , should be twice as bright .
I bought this thinking it will work with my 1994 Vw golf . The CD that comes with it is useless and outdated and the cable did not serve it 's intended purpose at the end
I 'd previously purchased this w/o having an actual use for it . Turned out to be practically custom made for putting oil in my Subaru inverter/generator .
Heavy grade plastic I just do n't like how they look on my jeep took them out and took the loss . Live and learn
I had this unit for about 2 months . Works fairly well . The tabs on the bottom of the unit broke after a month . I used tape for awhile and then gave up on it . Try the : Valterra A10-2606 FridgeCool 11.28 mA Fan with On/Off Switch . I 've had it for five years without any problem . The Valterra is much easier on batteries too .
Instant 12v receptacle , not much more I can say about it . the leads are a little scrawny but comparable to similar products .
Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Does n't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back , or hard-place them at the tires , because as soon as enough drift happens , the tire and chock move together .
This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming .
Again , miles of wire , easy instructions , everything you need for an install . The SlimLites are great as they take up lees room . The tucked behind my grill !
great stuff to have when it starts to rain . Do n't need it too often in So Cal , but when it does rain , it helps a lot with visibility , especially if you have n't gotten around to buying new wiper blades during the rest of the year .
This bulb is not 31mm , it 's more like 33mm . This is very important to know . It 's not that bright though . Buy AGT , Advanced German Techology . This is more like a cheap chinese knock off
Bought this cause of the name ... it does not smell good at all ... I used it once and have not used it again.. maybe its just my preference but I did not like it .
I love meguiar 's products but this wheel cleaner was a waste of money . It really did not clean the wheels as suggested . Do n't waste your money !
This gizmo is just what I needed to run my tire inflator directly off the battery to avoid blowing fuses . This does n't seem super heavy duty , but does the job just fine . btw , the compressor runs much faster directly off the battery than from the cigarette lighter.Note , the length of the cord is n't too long so I recommend the cigarette lighter extesion cord .
The instructions preclude using this as a chock when hitching or unhitching so what is the point ? What a waste of money .
Great addition for my Hi-lift jack . They should have included a quick release pin rather than a bolt to attach it to the jack . The hand tightened bolt vibrated loose and was lost on the first trail ride . Other than that it was well designed and of good quality and of great use the first time out .
Shipped in two days , great product , cleans and treats your K & N Air Filter . I use K & N filters on both my diesels and being able to clean and service them keeps my engines running great !
The adhesion is good and the thermo tape does its job . It 's good for protecting wires in your engine compartment or other high temperature places .
8 x 4 x 11 ! ! ! Dont make my mistake , this thing is tiny , check the dimensions . At nearly $ 13 you would think it would be of some size ? Wrong , again , my fault for not reading . Should be advertised and a bathroom trash can . There is no way this is worth $ 13 bucks !
Great product . Solid and well built . I like the fact that you can service it if needed . I would recommend this if you want a solid inflator gauge .
I Love it . Takes a while to break in until then you may get some wax streaks and not pick up all the dust but within a month it is perfect and like they say only improves the dirtier it becomes just shake off outside before putting back in the case and stuffing it in the trunk or map pocket .
Right part number and looks good . Clean package box although the tube ends did not have the caps like Fram , but will take Motorcraft any day .
My headlights were n't as bad as some and this stuff did n't do much to improve them . I did the optional sandpaper step and the only thing it really did was remove some of the surface roughness and make them smooth . It barely did anything to make them more clear .
I bought several LEd lights for my RV to test them out , and this one was way too blue for my taste . Bright for the lower number of LEDs it has , but the light does n't match my other bulbs and looks un-natural to me .
I needed a cover for my bike that I park outside , this cover is made to cover your bike inside to keep the dust off . very thin do n't think it would make it a full year outside so I got a heavy duty one . I use this one for a dust cover on my tool box .
Wiper came loose and allow arm to scratch wind shield . I even check several times to made sure wipers are attached securely . Lousy design .
These jack stands seem to be well made and I like the feature with the safety pin . I bought these to use on an old corvette and they are more than what is required for that purpose . I would have no problem using these on our chevy suburban .
Went on easy enough and dried to a hard material but did not work well on the type composite I was working with which was an old pellet gun stock . It does state may not bond some types of materials and I guess this was one of them .
This is a must have for pickup truck owners . The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place . The ratchet part is very well made . You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving . Have had no problems at all ... ..
I replaced my Honda Fit horn with this disappointment . All the reviewers that said this is not loud were correct.It sounds like the stock horn . This was a waste of time and money .
Dont buy not worth it to epensive did gave it a try but i had to remove it whith my regular body shine thank you
It is too small for my standard sized RV door which makes me wonder what sort of very thin door it is made for .
My 6 years old Mazda 6 2.5 liters GH 5 speed shifts abruptly from 1-2 gear , did tranny filter change and drain fill 3x , before pouring this whole bottle in ( ATF requires 8.5 liters ) . No difference at all , stills shift hard . However it does n't makes the shift worse so I 'll give it 2 stars for wasting my $ though it 's a cheap gamble .
If your thinking about getting this device take a look at the Camco screen door cross bar instead.This is a pain in the **s to install and wears quite easily
I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described . Even if they did what they are supposed to do , I did not realize that . It has not made a difference appearance-wise.Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer . Do I regret buying them ? No . I do not .
I actually bought these from a local auto parts store . This was about a year ago . It started raining out of no where and my old blades were not helping . Right out of the box these worked `` ok '' . Within a few months they were streaking , by the time the wet season ended they were totally ineffective . They actually made things worse .
The directions are poorly written ... .the process did not work for me . I was very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews .
Only the stand is aluminum . The center shaft , handle , and top are steel . Mine started to rust within a week of use .
In less than a year these brackets have rusted . The thing is I keep my Bike in the garage when not in use . Once again most likely made in China like must things SOLD at Amazon .
terrible piece of item i have ever purchased.i threw away the product , and purchased a better product at walmart .
Too light . Flimsy and just about useless . Great for new RV/Camper owners that are afraid they 'll get their hands dirty while dumping their RV/Camper tanks . They do n't fit well , slide around on your hands .
This is NOT the HEAVY DUTY wheel chock that Camco also sellsCamco 44492 RV Super Wheel ChockI bought this not paying very close attention to the details . It 's a nice wheel chock but I prefer to have a matching set of 4 .
... .which is true if I was changing the fog lights . While ordering the high beams the configuration guide suggested these as low beam . Not very good symmetry when obvious I was replacing high beam headlights not my fog lights . Seem well made and great packaging and Amazon was great about taking back .
Does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it 's cost . I installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease . All parts of the dynamat that I installed have good contact with the metal . I would return this but it is stuck to my car door ...
This is a well built wheel chock . It 's made out of thick plastic . I accidentally ran it over with my car . And it held up perfectly !
these are suppose to fit , but do not clip well . the holes are too small . save your cash and just get the wipers directly from a BMW dealer , they are not that much more expensive , this was a complete waste of time and money
My petite wife , stands at 5'3 '' , in her 50s , cut through the top portion ( the `` hardened steel '' ) portion of the lock in 75 minutes with a HAND SAW blade . Imagine what a power tool would have done through this lock.I ca n't recommend it .
This wiper did not fit a 2006 Cadillac STS even thought it says it does . The adapter did not work !
there was so much product that I was able to dynomat all 4 doors and truck & I still have over half the dynomat left for other projects .
Look everybody 's looking for a good lead , look no more you found it . If looking for a lead on a good job sorry it will not work for that .
I bought this from Amazon last year and went to use it again the other day . The cap had rusted through for some reason ! I keep this in a waterproof toolbox with a desiccant to keep the humidity low , but somehow it just rotted away . They product itself is great , but it 's pretty hard to use now that the lid is gone .
the clamps are chincy , the wire guage is smaller than the 12 ' extension I put on the other end of it . If you 're not going to put a huge load on it then I 'm sure it will work but you get what you pay for . If it was heavier duty and had an in-line fuse then I 'd be happy with it .
This does what it says it does . It is really heavy and is a bit much to lug around , but overall good .
I love drying my Evo X with these . They get all the water off and leave to streaks . Its a must have when detailing your car
After one trip , the pin is coated in rust . The cotter pin was also extremely difficult operate . A tiny bit more flexibility would make it easier to use and would n't compromise any safety.The fact that this is covered in rust would prevent me from buying .
They squish flat even lifting my '96 328I which is not a heavy car . Ca n't think about using them on my Tiguan since it is even heavier . The way they bend flat I ca n't imagine them holding up for a long time
it was hard to fit or put inDid I say I smell Chinese dung..well does not fit like it was made for the carI smell Chinese dung.. do n't you
These are great for my Trailblazer , but huge for my daughter 's Camaro . So keep in mind , you may want to go with a smaller ton stand if you do n't have a truck or SUV
Rather than buying the individual spray bottles it is easier to buy the refill in addition to one spray bottle . Mothers makes the best products hands down .
If u buy this unit , for your own sake , only use water clean up material , because you will be doin a lot of it . Unlike my othe HVLP system I use for Urathanes and fine finish , this unit gets material EVERYWHERE and mostly where you DO N'T WANT IT ... ... ...
This chamois is very thin and will not last long . I purchased same item two months ago and is falling apart . After purchasing again realized this chamois is too thin and will not hold up with repeated usage .
squeep-squeep-thunk.thunk-snack , thunk-snack.knock-whack , knock-whackkveetch-chit-chit-crunk-snitBut why belabor the point . Worked well for about six months , then started smearing a little , and the noises got more interesting over time . And intolerable.Back to Bosch for me .
Works as advertised and the price is very good . A bit hard to lock and unlock but not enough to matter . Hopefully I 'll never find out how well it protects the hitch from theft !
Meant to be used with a drill instead of a buffer . It did n't state this in the description and I was hoping for the best . Decent pads for the money . The pads are a little low on quality compared to some other brands . I would have had to pay for the return shipping so I just kept the kit .
These are well made , inexpensive , and work great . They are quality made in USA ! And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order .
Just do n't plan to pull it out when the tires are resting against it - the grips really dig in and with 2 on the axle and a slight grade they work perfectly .
I have two K & N air filters for each car , and truck I own . Put on a clean one . Wash the dirty one . Better gas mileage . no more to buy . SW
As title says , I did not see any difference even after applying for long time . It would probably work better on older paints . Meguiar should have specified in the description , that this product is not recommended for good condition surfaces.I Do not recommend this one .
The items that came with the kit appear to be of good quality and should be useful on the trail . Seems a bit overpriced for the overall kit . You still need to buy some quality chain to go with the kit . So expect to spend another 50-100 dollars for that .
I have had one of these for years and loved it . My wife did n't know what it was so she thought it was old and garbage .
Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts . This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento .
Seemed like a good idea , but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads . I returned it .
Bought this because of all the reviews , but it did not work for me . My Harley uses an AGM battery , and found out after the purchase that this charger can not charge an AGM battery . For a simple battery maintainer , this product is big and heavy . I expected more .
W0W ... ..This filter fits exactly like the OEM filter But will allow much better air flow to my big V8 & save me sum $ $ $ $ $ @ the same time . I recommend this unit to anyone looking for added performance & mileage . A+ & # 34 ; Ca n't beat K/N & # 34 ;
My Hi-Lift with the cast base ( v. the stamped ) does n't fit very well in this . Not sure if I will end up using it .
Worked well for me , hard to apply - after work is done get ready to spend even more time cleaning your car from CLAY . But overall - it worked , ca n't complain . Removed contaminants very good and price is fair . ( See my other reviews of Meguiar 's products . ) Recommended .
I liked the look of these when they arrived . However they are not very heavy gauge metal and bend easily when installed onto the tail lights . The only good thing about this , is that they bend back into place just as easily as they had bent out of shape . Nice looking , but need to be better made .
I use it in every one of my cars ! Fits well and its washable/reuse for the life of the car .
I bought the full set of these , and in triple quanities due to TV muscle car recommendations , No wonder local auto parts stores dont carry this products , It stained my dash and speedometer plastic , leaves residue in windsheild over spray , .
I bought this unit for hard to reach grease fittings . So far I have used it to gease u joints . Works decent .
Leaves a sticky finish on my sofa , and does not protect against mild dew . I used Meguiar car leather cleaner and conditional , this really cleans my sofa well and does n't leave a oily surface . Meguiar reduce the mild dew problem significantly .
This was 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon vs a local auto parts store . If you use it properly and service your air filter as you should , you will not go wrong with this product .
The kit cleans and treats the filter to keel it working as it should . Not much else to say about it .
This lock appears to be nearly identical to the old masterlock design . That one built up rust inside the lock mechanism , so this will probably do the same . It is a few mm 's shorter than the masterlock and barely clears my curt hitch holes , so you may want to try before you buy on this one .
No matter how little or how much plummers tape I used this unit would not seal . And the butterfly valve metal bends easily . Would not recommend . I ended up putting the original plastic plug back in . DIsappointed .
I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna . If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these , I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance .
It works well , I wanted to just keep track of how my tire wear was . My only concern was that it is not really calibrated to be right on the money , but if you keep this in mind , it is just an offset .
Five stars because they are lightweight , inexpensive and have a hole for a rope ; tie two together , pull both at the same time . Ordered four for tandom axle trailer .
Great for all those black trims on the car.Not a permanent fix , but should be good for a few months , depending on how faded your black parts are .
I have a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe and these backup bulbs will not fit into the sockets . This was a total waste of time and I returned them for a refund .
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues . I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I 'm curious .
This is the old stand-by and works very well - you can always turn so you can see the dial . It does n't always sit well on the stems for some reason , but using this with an air compressor is so much faster than a small 12-volt compressor and hand gauge .
The pin ( 10mm ) is too wide for the disc brake holes and the disk is too wide for the lock to easily slip on and off without damaging the dick bake itself . Great lock for other bikes I suspect , but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes .
One down side , bottles can and will fell off due to the fact of the design . Adjustable arms can not hold a & # 34 ; full heavy & # 34 ; 16oz water bottle ... ... those arms spread easier than a _________ legs.I actually got'em glue with epoxy using a coke bottle as standard measure ; be careful not to glue'em to wide apart or the lid wont close .
I bought this to compare to my favorite one . I ca n't see any differance ? So give it a try . Costs a little less too . SW
My new Focus comes with dealer plate , replacing it with this plus screw cover and there 's no ad anymore , I like it .
Have n't tried it yet since I purchased it for an emergency . But it seems good . I will let everyone know once I actually use it .
But then after about 4 months of use , it just completed stopped working . So I would definitely not buy again .
Wheel chocks are a must for every Rver . This is of particular importance if you use the tri-leveler or other similar device .
By far this is the best hose nozzle . Look at the reviews . There 's a reason it 's rated so high . It 's very durable and easy to use . With so many spray settings , you do n't need anything else . It goes from a soft spray to a very powerful stream . I highly recommend this product .
This cleaner and oilier work great and restore the filter to like new condition just make sure you do n't use a lot of oil because it will cause problems with the MAF sensor or even foul spark plugs in extreme cases .
I wanted to save a few bucks and paint instead of buying caliper covers . I know paint prep is important for this type of job and spend at least 30 min on each wheel . I also followed the temperature and curing times closely . I used 3 to 4 coats on each caliper . Within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off .
Probably a good filter but did n't fit the application . Amazon made it right , but be sure this fits your car before buying .
I would recomend this for any DIYr ! It 's great to have around the garage when you need a gasket on the fly ! Remeber , to let the gasket cure for 24 hours !
This product has silicone which has been proven to degrade tires and dry them out . So while this product will make your tires look shiny , the tires will not last as long if you use this.The manufacturer claim that this product protects your tires is completely false .
I got these today..and tried to put on car ... Well guess what ... The holes at the attachment points are way too small ... Big surprise . I would guess all these would be a standard size ... So Beware folks , , , this makes them useless for me ...
I wo n't recommend this product . I have a compressor for my car ( 12V ) and I bought this . It dose n't work
It 's a Fram - a name I 've learned to trust over the years . My only gripe is that none of my cap filters fit on the end , even the small ones .
The deflector does a good job navigating the air in the direction desired and the magnets reliably hold it in place on a vertical vent in a wall . I am happy with the product , happy enough to order another one !
So I recommend this to clean your tires , but it will strip the wax coating off the rims and leave the rims really dry ... ...
Too hard to empty into a small mouth container like a gas can . I store old oil in an old plastic 5 gallon gas can and empty when full this pan is a bear when directly trying to fill the can . I have to use a funnel which is just another item I need to clean .
Just trust me here ; get this and the Meguiars drying towel and you 'll have your car completely dry and streak free in no time . This soaks up the bulk of the water and the other gets rid of all the mist . Great product that I 've been using for years !
One of these kits will last you for your entire life . Anybody using K & N ; air filter MUST buy this as it 's the essential way to keep it lasting the life of your car . A+Cheers
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller . There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware .
Cheap plastice mirrow for watching your blind spont . Better than the round type , this one wasnt all bad .
Junk . Watch the videos on Youtube . It 's effortless to get off .
i used the one from craftsman an it doesnt work as well as this one . i recommend this to everyone
The install was pretty easy and the theory seems solid however this just does n't work . I tried multiple times with almost zero cleaning . I would skip this product .
i am using this in 40-50 degree weather so I think it 's too cold to use this product so i only gave it a 4/5 . i am assuming once it gets warm i will have a better experience .
I ordered 6 of these and it didnt last , used them onmy new dodge ram 1500 and it was disappointing on new Goodyear tires , i went with Duplicolor Tire spray and it last soooo much , longer
this stuff cleaned my intake filter like a charm ! next time i will buy an aerosol version though as this one is kind of dirty to use : )
Waited too long to get this ... after breaking connectors and fingernails it was time ... Good tool and a fair price - MADE IN USA ! !
If you need a new tire cover and do n't care about having something printed on it give this a look . It just fit my 255-70 R15 tires on my Jeep and has held up for about 12 month since it was installed . The only this I have noticed about it is that it is very hard to keep it looking clean and black without dirt streaks in it .
I was expecting a solid rubber-like product . It looks and feels like moulded plastic . Seems to do the job though , and it 's very light-weight.Update - Changed my mind . Forgot they were in place and rolled my trailer right over the top of them . Crushed them flat . Worthless , in my opinion .
Bought for a 2001 Maxima and it was a perfect fit . I like to keep my air cleaner really clean and this should serve my purpose well ... I also bought the recharge kit which is also OEM K & N . Would recommend to anyone in the market for a K & N filter . : )
These Suck . I bought 2 of these for my car , and only one of them worked . The one that did work was blinding and made the vehicle look tacky.Would not recommend
I got this to change oil on my 2005 Honda Odyssey and it made the job of changing oil very easy . I was able to get nearly 4 1/2 quarts of oil in a couple of minutes with out any spill . It 's also multi purpose ! Very good value for the money paid .
Not really impressed with this product . The Meguiar 's cleaner/wax product does a much better job . This may be good for some cars , but not mine .
I ordered two of these filters . The packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box . However both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.I returned them for a refund.Metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent Toyota filters.Maybe a reason to use the bigger size .
Did not fit my car 's filter harness after Amazon 's compatibility tool said it would , there was a 1.5 & # 34 ; gap compared to the OEM filter , I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car
Kit did not work the way I thought it would . Had a hard time keeping the spring attached either to the door or RV body . Spring is so strong that it kept pulling the screws out of the door or RV body . Would not use this item . I ended up not using is at all.Would not recommend this kit ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
This is a well made water regulator but it restricts the water flow to much so there is hardly any pressure in the camper . Basically , a waste of money IMHO . Get one with a pressure gauge and that allows you to regulate the actual water pressure .
They did what they are supposed to kept my trailer from rolling away i am going to the Lynx chocks due to upgrading to the Lynx levelers .
There 's not too much exciting here , but after using these pads on a couple of cars , I can tell you that they hold up to extended use , do n't break apart , and the hook and loop backing works perfectly . You definitely can not go wrong here .
This gauge is accurate and easy to read , but it is very difficult to get a good seal . There is no rubber inside the stem and you have to get the right angle to get a good seal . In the meantime air is escaping and its a game to get the tire pressure right where you want it .
OEM from K & N ... I have not used it yet but it is just the same as you can purchase anywhere else for the premium price . I am new to K & N air filters so I will provide additional feedback if I find it does not work as advertised later on ...
Amazingly wipes off dust keeping your car cleaner between washes . If you have a black car , you want to buy this product and use it often .
I purchased these water filters to lessen the likelihood of water spots after washing my vehicles as suggested in several online forums . Unfortunately , we have very hard water here in the Northeast and it did not resolve the issue with spotting .
This is cheap and it feels cheap , but it works and thats all that matters . I have one on the floor and two on the ceiling for months .
If you have the rechargable air filter , this is a must to clean and re-oil the filter . IMHO you ca n't go wrong with K & N products .
I ordered two models of Deflecto vents and both are outstanding . Heavy duty plastic , large strong magnets on the side and they work perfectly . Would recommend to anyone , especially since these are impossible to find locally , just try asking for one in your local home depot/lowes , they 're never even heard of the product .
This pad works well with my Porter Cable 7424 auto polisher.I used it with wax , polish , and glaze , and it works well with all of them.If I can get a few more uses out of it I will come back and give it 5 stars .
Fram 's a solid name in the motoring industry and at a price that 's still reasonable . Never had a filter fail in a car or bike . Buying the multi-pack for the bike was a great value since oil is changed more frequently with motorcycles .
Do n't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB , it will NOT fit ! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere !
This product did a great job of balancing the temperatures throughout my home by correcting the direction of the air flow . The magnets are super strong and the materials super clear .
I found this to be too soft - everythin on your hands and nails . as such , it does n't pick up everything either . I had to go over the same surface 2 to 3 times to get glossy smooth finish . Also the yellow color on the clays seems like added paint color . it started coming off of the clay when going over the surface . Not good .
I ordered this vest in XL it says XL but its sized so small . It actually is a medium . If your going to order this vest make sure the size you order is three times what you normally wear . ORDER LARGER . I ordered it so I can wear a hoodie under it and there is no way it would ever fit .
My result using this was not very good . It tends to leave light dried wax residue streaks that you can not set while drying the car and only notice later . This will promote you to wipe them off , which subsequently can leave more swirls on your car.I think you are better off not using this and just waxing your car normally a little more often .
It is clear and the flip thing works fine . It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly . It does come with a mount for you to use , just no glue . But , as I said , it fit my old one with no problems at all .
I bought this first thinking it would be a good buy . I left it in my glove box , only to find it one day , bent . Did not last long in storage . I then I bought the digital tire pressure and tread depth combo . Way better product . Look up - Accutire MS-48B Digital Combination Tire Thread Depth Gauge and Tire Pressure Gauge
Nice cargo bar for the price . Easy to use and racheting works good . Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed !
I do n't have a major problem with this wax but I do n't love it . I can see the lifespan of the wax coating being short .
These wiper blades leaves a smear on the driver side 2005 Ford F-150 that is outright dangerous if driving at night . I discovered the problem during a 2,200 road trip through Colorado in January . Not being able to see at night is no fun . Having to stop at gas station to do the wiper 's job is silly . These wipers are expensive but their performance is unacceptable .
Solid piece of equipment , I do n't think I 'll ever buy the other `` garden '' variety hose head anymore ... .WOW I just wrote review on a hose head ! ! ! That saying something
I bought this one as a spare just in case I break the new one . sucks when you break the strap in mid stream
Try unit out when I first bought it . Everything seem ok. Did not use for a month and then when I try it again , background light no longer works . Only used it once prior to light burning out . Too late to return unit with incurring shipping cost .
It 's thinner than I had expected . Only time will tell how it would hold up to my abuse.Btw , I used solution from a tinting kit to put it on , and it worked fine . It takes A LOT of time and PATIENCE to get it to stick to the edge ( curve ) of the door sill .
These work as a 3156 backup light but not a 3157 . My 96 F350 needs 3157 for running , turn , and break lights . These do n't work . I plugged them into my backup light 3156 and they did work .
According to the selection process , it showed that this product fits my car . I have had trouble making this fit for my car . Again , with all my reviews , I research more than the average person and thus far I had to put the old wiper blades back on my car - sorry ... . I hate giving bad reviews , but this is what I feel .
This travel blanket is awsome . My wife loves it . She does not have heated seates so this is the next best thing . Plugs into the 12 volt power supply
The bracket was great , but as it turned out it was not needed because the multi-tow adapter came with one . Amazon credited me and said do n't bother sending back . Very pleased with amazon .
I did n't expect much from this cover considering the price , but I was surprised at how cheaply made this cover is . I broke two of the four straps that are used to secure the covers - they just pulled apart from the cover . I do not recommend these covers since the fastening mechanisms are faulty .
It is thinner than the stock air cleaner . I put this in at the same time as I added a Dynomax cat-back exhaust system . The truck can stay in 4 cylinder mode longer now , theoretically boosting my mileage a bit . Having used K & N replacement filters for years , this one did not disappoint .
Heavy duty , no flaws . Easy to use . Make sure you bend in the tabs to prevent the insert from falling out later . These are great .
I previously owned the cable luber that only has 1 thumb screw . Could never get that one to work . I thought this one would do the trick . I could not get this one to work as well .
This kit made my 5-year-old K & N filter look like new . And it took only a few minutes with very little effort .
They do exactly what you want them to and show no signs of breaking after weekly moves and daily use for almost a year .
My last set of bulbs from Sylvania were brighter than these and lasted 5 months longer . The four month life span i got out of these did dissapoint .
What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product . When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it 's the old name they are not familiar with .
Its a great leather conditioner , I use it all the time i highly recommend this product . I am pleased with the ongoing results on my leather car seats . Unfortunately i did not use this from amazon , because of the poor packaging , it leaked all over the place .
I used some of this on my headphones to help deaden the bass . It works very well , but then I found out there is cheaper stuff available . So I would shop around before getting this , but it does work very well .
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust . Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid . Will update with results .
My wheels have large openings between the spokes , so I guess I did n't think out my purchase properly when buying this.If you have smaller openings it may suit you , but for me it just does n't cover enough & # 34 ; real estate & # 34 ; for the work I have to do when I use it .
Like other reviewers , I found that the nozzle spins or not , as it chooses . I tested it three different times , and it only spun one of those times . Obviously , this is something you ca n't easily detect or fix once the unit is installed.Back to Amazon . I 'll use the wand-down-the-toilet until I find a product that works properly .
This product works well . However as some others have said a bolt to hold the thing on the jack is n't really needed and is rather cumbersome to remove and install . A quick pin would have been better . DO YOU HEAR THAT HI-LIFT ?
The power cleaner cleans well and sprays well , and the oil sprays nice and evenly . I just washed my filter in the sink ... probably should n't have , but I did .
I have used both cans of this product on different cars . The product results in a tremendous amount of emissions being spewed into the air when sucked into the vacuum system as described in the articles I read about the product before purchasing it . In addition to creating air pollution and drawing angry stares from neighbors , I am simply not convinced the product is effective .
Thought I have n't officially used it much , it 's still working . It 's consistent , responsive , and loud enough but I thought it would be louder ( 10 more decibels would have been 5 stars ) .
This what you should do instead buying new filters . The cleaning steps are very easy and also when applying the oil on the filter
I purchased some much thicker microfibre towels , as these ones just are n't thick enough to soak up sufficient water . These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interior
Purchased a set of these to replace originals in my 2010 SUV . Absolutely no difference in brightness . One of the worst investments I ever made . Do n't waste your money . Having someone walk in front of you with a lit candle would be just as good .
Have not used it yet , but wish it did not come with the clay bars ... they just look like more work will be required .
Didnt work . Gimmick . Dont take this product as anything better than any other product claiming to do the same thing .
These fit perfectly and are easy to use and keep your connector clean and dry when not in use . Great buy .
Cheapo replacement for the one I wore out . But the tip has not cover on the metal wire wrapped around the bristles so I can pretty much guarantee it 'll scratch the tire . Until I find a good rubber tip to glue on it wo n't get used on my wheels . Not worth sending back . This is not the one to buy until they fix that little tip .
I followed the instructions TO THE LETTER , and my headlights look the same as they did before ! This product did not work at all for me !
I purchased this lock for the spare tire on my trailer . It seems like it could be broken without too much effort , but should help deter theft by being there .
Do your research people , this thing is the best for drying your car . It helps so much when washing your own car . Do n't use rags that will drag dirt & hold onto rocks to scratch your paint . I ca n't go with out this thing and I truly stand by it.Highly recommendVery easy to use and saves you timeFast and easy shippingLove it
This worked great , easy to put on and feels good too.Hard to find also , and it shipped fast.I bought a used truck and previous owner wore a lot of rings and the steering wheel was beat up.Now it looks great.2008 Ford F-150 4X4 Truck
Tested on a discharged battery and it charged it over night . Great for your boat/bike or anything that you need to charge over night for use the next day . If your looking for a charger that charges in 10 mins . this is not the one . Great product , and shipping . Thanks Amazon
i orderd at least 4 none worked until the final try , it works but has no intall help like others have they all had bad disc .
Walmart sells it for $ 14.99 . Amazon needs to drop the price to at least $ 14.99.Edit : Does what it says it does and does it well . 5 stars for the product itselfThanks to Amazon for adjusting the price to market conditions . 5 stars for the price also .
I bought this and the conditioner and I found them to work well . They definitely spruced up my nice older Stressless leather chairs .
I much prefer this version to the pump version . It 's nice and easy to just use the self propelled spray to re oil the filter . Nice that it 's bigger than the one that comes in the kit too .
The leather conditioner is great , but the price is a bit high for the amount in the bottle I think .
Does what it says , seems to be good quality . I wish the wires were wrapped though . I ended up wrapping the wires with black electrical tape for a cleaner look and additional wire protection .
these are the worst wiper blades I have ever used . they leave streaks on the windshield and do a horrible job in the rain . I tried to contact the seller to ask them for an exchange only to be told that my return date expired . If there were negative stars I would use them for this product.. Even cheap wiper blades do a better job than these blades .
I really like these high-quality , `` fireman-type '' , and high-output nozzles . They are built VERY WELL and output a lot of water . If you do n't want high water output , then do n't get this nozzle , otherwise , I would highly recommend spending more money to get one of these rather than the cheaper nozzles . I think it 's worth it .
This product is obviously manmade but is equal to or better than any 'natural ' chamois I ever had . It 's just marvelous .
I used this once to charge a new battery . It worked fine for that.I left the battery on the charger over the winter months and the battery was dead come that spring .
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference .
I can not tell the difference between using this cleaner and using just soap and water . The scrubber brush is nice .
It looks as if it should work but I have yet to test it so the jury is still out on its overall performance .
I used one of these for the last 5 years and is the best I 've used to dry my cars . really is outstanding and the best for this task .
This item includes ( 2 ) very small pieces of sandpaper of different coarseness ( It would be nice if they were labeled ) , ( 2 ) small tubes of polishing compound and ( 2 ) small polishing cloths . In my opinion , it & # 8217 ; s not worth the price .
If you do a lot of work with bearings or bearing assemblies , this can be a useful tool . You simply hold the end of the probe against the housing or stationary bearing race , and listen . A grinding or crunching sound means the bearing is rough/dry . Used properly , it can save a lot of diagnostic time . Quality seems to be good .
These lights are very bright and have a excellent warranty . They work great on the A post of jeep wranglers . They are very easy to install great directions and guides . These are very good off road light .
I 'm surprised so many people give this high marks . To me it seems like nothing but a come on to get you to buy a $ 20/month website service with which to interpret the readings .
This was a & # 34 ; eh give it a shot & # 34 ; purchase and I already regret the purchase . The tip of the wand is coming apart , and it really doesnt make the cleaning of a rim or wheel easier .
This does n't fit my outside filter for my rv . the filter just kinda rest on it . total waste of money
For the past year , I have been using these with my Mastech power supply . While I have mixed feelings about my Mastech power supply , the leads are fine . The cables are flexible enough and the clips feel reasonably precise .
I put one of these in my RV 's porch light to replace the standard bulb and it melted . I checked the socket with a millimeter and the socket turned out to be fine . Not sure if it was just a bad unit or what , but I threw the other one away as I have no desire to have a fire .
The ramp keeps sliding on the pavement . So I put a towel under it . Did not work . It seems only way this ramp will work is to back it up with something to keep it from sliding . Returned
To be honest , the towel was n't really that water `` magnet '' . I personally find my old towel would do a much better job .
I order this core remover and got a cheap piece of junk . The one sent was silver and did not even have the non slip end on it.I NOTIFIED AMAZON on THIS ITEM .
I followed the instructions to the `` T '' on my '10 Wrangler . I let it dry 3-4 hours between three coats . The first time it rained , the `` finish '' spotted up , and looked terrible . VERY Disappointed .
The 4Wire Flat Replacement Dust Covers help keep the ends clean from road dirt .
Bad design ... The two doors that cover the hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered , can easily be misplaced . Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit . LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it . I will keep it as long as the pump works .
It 's worth the money even though it is sent with some hardware that in no way fits my bike ... I had it reupholstered and used different hardware to attach it ... why ... because I did n't pay much for it and it looks great and gives me what I wanted ... getting away from saddle bags ...
They shipped this in a box with no wrapping around it . This allowed cardboard dust to get all over it . There is a ton of lint and residue left behind . I bought these for auto detailing mainly to remove wax or quick detail . I would not use to buff wax . The residue is annoying . Buy a better quality cloth .
I bought this to go with my Porter-cable 150psi , 6 Gal . compressor . Although the compressor comes with a tire inflation device , I like this one for the built-in gauge , the extension hose and the quality construction .
broke on day 1. bit cheap in construction.would recommend different product , or even a different approach all together
Went to screw on the pump to a quart of oil and cheap plastic lid broke right off . After fabricating another lid , found that this will work good for topping off the transmission fluid , but not for a fluid change as it took 15 minutes for about 6 ounces of fluid to transfer . Used the old fashioned tube and upside down bottle instead .
I sprayed this on a car part , without doing any prior cleaning with a disk pad , I have n't noticed anything changed .
Does what it says it does ... ... looks great !
It 's what the company recommends and most people do n't want to experiment with other products to see IF they work or not and take a chance on ruining their expensive filter .
This made the removal of my inner tie rods very easy . I have had issues in the past and wish I had this tool . I will use it only few times in my life but it was worth it .
I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat . Very cheaply made . The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat . Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !
Very good sound dampener it makes my trunk sounds very smooth and not rattly . I have my entire trunk lined with this stuff and all you can hear from the outside is true bass no rattling .
I wanted to cover my spare . Received this the day before I went out of town . Right out of the box , one of the seams at the black cording was already frayed . Poor quality , but you get what you pay for .
Like others it needs more notches as it is about an inch in between and when rolling truck onto a life you have to squeeze them in , Still all in all for the price it is a good buy
Put these in my Tacoma and they are nice and bright but low beam went out on one side after 6 months . I drive with my lights on all the time so that had a lot to do with it .
I used this is a 2008 Freightliner with a Detroit engine . The engine was in good shape but I just had to try it . It did nothing . Snake oil I tell ya . Pure Snake oil .
Bristles are way too stiff . I used this brush once on my cloth seats ( VW GTI ) to remove a small , quarter-sized stain . It left permanent damage to the surface of the seat . And I did n't even use much pressure . Cleaning should be 80 % chemical and 20 % brush . You do not need a brush this stiff , unless you 're maybe cleaning wood/metal .
This seems to be working fine for me using the Torque app on Android.Issues I have found-The device mac address is generic and can cause issues with multiple devices-have to enter the password for the device every time the app is shutdown
it did the work , nothing special is just bondo , but it gets the job done , i used to cover to samll holes in the trunk of my accord , since i removed the H emblem sign .
This chamois works great . Very absorbent and holds a lot of water . Do not use anything else to wash your car .
feels like i am being choked to death but does keep my neck warm . a similar material but scarf like would be better
These work perfectly on both ends of the connection for my motorhome and trailer . They protect the contacts very well . I highly recommend them .
It 's bigger and feels more secure then our older pair of wheel chocks.Holds our trailer in place with no issues . Not much else to say for such a simple product .
Horrible material ! I have to say that this was a total waste of money ! I would not recommend this to my worst enemy ( yes I would ) !
I am not sure what the problem is , but I used toothpaste at first and did n't notice a lot of difference on my 2009 Camry lens covers . So I bought this and I do n't see any difference .
I tried to get this thing to work but could not . The LED light would never come on . I followed the directions exactly as stated for my specific vehicle from the xpresskit web site but no go . It just did not work so I sent it back to Amazon .
Bosch has always been my wiper blade choice , until now . These blades just do not conform to the windshield . It 's not on an unusual vehicle , just a plain old Dodge Dakota . They miss strips in both passes resulting in a messy windshield most of the time .
came on time excellent quality works well with the multi meter i would recommend this product to any one who asks about them
I hand to do some rewriting due to an accident and this adapter helped me . The diagnostic lights were very useful to troubleshoot the connections . The only complaint is that in my vehicle , a 2009 Ram , this adapter was big enough to block the other connector in my hitch .
I highly recommend this product for when you want to re-oil your K & N or any brand of high perf air filter whether it be cone or panel . Not as much waste , easier to apply than the squirt bottle type .
How much can I say about an oil filter . Fits my bike and price was good . No complaints . Would buy again .
i bought these for my rv trailer . They are too flimsy and thin for the weight ofmy trailer and the do not fit well under the tires . the lip is guess you would call it is too thing to fit snug in place . there is no string to help you remove or pull them away when packing up . i am buying a different set .
This product I 've used in the past with great results . Better mileage and cost savings .
i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it , it did not clean all the dust like it said it would
I added this to my spare on my boat trailer . It was plenty long and built well . Not much else to say .
I installed these in my 5th wheel RV and they worked great . I went in at the end of the summer and turned them on , all of them are blinking and some are completely off . The circuit boards can not handle summer temperatures in a hot RV . Do not buy for RV usages unless you will only be in cooler climates .
I could n't see any improvement at all . I sanded , I polished , over and over again . I got nothing . This was a total waste of money .
The covers pop off and are worthless . Do n't buy this junk ! Looks great when you install but the covers wo n't stay on when the car is moving .
We use these for our camper . They are light weight , easy to store , and worth the money . I feel that they are pretty durable and do n't anticipate them breaking .
I bought this in conjunction with spark plugs and anti seize and it worked great to dial in the plugs .
Rain-X makes terrible wipers , but you do n't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip : do n't put it on the side windows , unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open .
it helps you address wiring issues as soon as yopu pl ; ug in without running around the trailer for a light check .
Not really worth having as the brush is smaller than the head making it hard to get it in the hard to reach spots.The brush is not very sturdy so does n't last very long .
Keep all those sham wows . I have used Absorber Chamois for years , much better than natural ones or any other brands .
The first worked so well I decided to purchase a second to keep in the car . Not why , but as advertised the dirtier it gets the better seems to work . As long as you use as suggested , dust your car , and not try to clean heavy dirt with it , it will leave your car spotless .
Used this tape many times over the years and it does what they say.Recently installed a cat-back system on my Jeep and the pipe was pretty close to my shock.Wrapped some of this tape around the shock where it seems close to the exhaust and my shock oil should be alright .
Meguiar 's has always had great products so I thought I 'd try it and compare it to my Viking Microfiber Waffle Weave Drying Towel . It does n't really compare ... .far less absorbent , and too small . I can dry my whole Range Rover with the Viking ... this barely made it past the 2nd quarter panel .
Used these on my ventage auto chrome plate frame.They look nice & fit well . I like them & recommend them .
I bought this mainly for charging my apple laptop and it did n't work . I never tried it for anything else so I ca n't comment on whether it works for other applications . I was disappointed because I thought for sure that this one would work after trying others with lower wattages . I ended up sending it back .
The helmet is a large , however , the unit is running small sizes . It sets too high on my head . I could use a extra-large size
I have eight of these things now . They hold-up great , are dirt cheap and you ca n't lose them in the grass because of the bright yellow color . If you abuse them enough , they will show wear and tear , but that 's if you abuse them - you know , like driving over them instead of moving them : - (
This is a great idea , but the one I received had several pinhole leaks . Not just seepage , but small jets of water from bad casting .
There 's really nothing to this gauge . Very simple and it works.If it was shorter would 've been even better , but it 's okay for $ 5.Not greasy/oily on mine as others have reported .
I purchased this gauge on Amazon for $ 5.99 with FREE Super Saver ShippingIt is a handy tool and quite useful ; the only drawbackfor me is that it only measures in imperial measurements.Metric measurements are always more precise .
This made retracing the brake piston a breeze . Made changing my brakes much easier . I highly recommend this product for brake jobs .
easy to use , very solid . the double locking is a great feature but is kind of over kill . Love it !
I feel like I could probably get away with dish soap and water but this is so cheap/long lasting that I do n't find it worth the risk/reward to find out .
The Coleman Cable 08665 12-Feet Heavy-Duty Truck and Auto Battery Booster are great , heavy and fit perfectly into the Arsenal 5888 Cable organizer . Hopefully i do n't ever need to use them but better to be prepared than sorry .
This kit is just ok. Every piece in the kit is extremely light weight . If you are a mall crawler and only hit fire roads than this will do fine , if it 's much more than that then look at the ARB kits .
Put this on my 2005 Toyota Prius and it worthless . Does n't touch the windscreen in the center 2-3 inches . This leave a big wet streak right in your field of view . Standing still or a t highway speeds no difference .
I tried this out , twice as per the instructions . Didnt make much difference at all . Should have just kept my $ 20 .
Tool feels sturdy and like it would help , but ended up being a useless tool in the arsenal . I would n't recommend this since you can hand tighten the oil filter if you used a textured one like the purolator .
I have to agree with another reviewer that this cloth is almost identical to those you find in Walmart . It is THIN THIN THIN and not at all worth the price . This is a surprise from Mothers as I use a lot of their products and typically their quality is excellent .
My review basically says it all . I did not have a chip , I had a spider webbing crack , about 1 inch by 1 inch . This did nothing for it .
I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep . I just took one of the bolts out and put this in , I would thing if they really want it I 'm sure they can get it out , this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard . And for the price you can buy two..
I 'm a huge fan of Master products & this does not let me down . Very easy to use low profile lock to protect your trailer hitch attachments . I love the bright blue tip .
Dynamat is great , it 's the original , you ca n't go wrong . I 'm strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as I upgrade their stereo systems completely . But I plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well , under the carpet .
takes a while to warm up , ok as the package says give it 10 minutes . warm after 2 minutes , nice after 6 , toasty after 15.papers say 4A / 48W , and it comes with a spare 7A fuse for the plug.price was decent , seems to work ok , plaid seems a bit faked but still attractive ; hope it will last for a while .
I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car . The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use . They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning .
These are well-built ( made in China though , not like previous Bosch from Europe ) , they seem to be long-lasting and streak free , but the 26 '' left a HUGE swath of my windshield uncleared on my '07 accord . The 18 '' works great though .
this has been a must have in the detailing word . This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away . Quality and works excellent , does not scratch . NEVER use another brand !
These neither fit my smallest cabinet in my RV nor do they fit well within their telescoping tube . Kind of wobbly . I am not sure what to do with them at this point , except maybe the trash .
The LEDs died on this item but it still charges . I will investigate the warranty and get back here . Purchased thru Amazon fulfilled by HRPWorld.com
Although I consider myself reasonably , handy , I could never find a way to install this screen door closure kit on my Winnebago-Itasca motorhome . None of the examples cited in the instructions would apply to my screen door . Fortunately , I had less than six bucks invested , so it was no great loss to throw the kit away .
Easy to install . I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on . I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket .
As we all know , dust gets over your rides in the garage , and is nice to be able to dust it off instead of complete re-detail ! .
I am NOT impressed with this multimeter . The controlls are NOT intuitive to anyone who is used to using multimeters . The battery check function is just a gimmick . I am NOT comfortable with a meter that ALWAYS shows a reading even when not connected to anything ... .
this steering shaft is of poor design . the factory shaft is much better than this one . I installed it no problem , but the clearances were bigger then the one I took off . I do n't recommend this item for any one trying to up grade to something better . ITS not ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
I have used this to power a compressor I used to change my break fluid and to put air in my tires . I love this little gadget . I lost a sleeve on one of the negative ( black ) clips . Still works great but I deducted a star due to the sleeve sliding off . Not a deal breaker by any means.Buy this product . It is very handy .
Okay , I did n't expect a lot , but I did expect it to inflate an automobile tire . Compressor would come on , but tire would totally deflate while running -- same thing with trying to inflate a bicycle tire ! I learned my final lesson with Slime . This was not my first faulty product from this manufacturer .
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as well
I used this after the Lexol cleaner , and it did a terrific job on our seats . It was easy to apply , and when buffed out , the material looked great .
VERY CHEAP . LOCKING MECHANISM FELL OUT THE FIRST TIME I USED THIS CAP . PASS ON THIS ONE . CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP . WASTE OF MONEY .
Price was attractive but very poor quality construction material . I have not use because I am afraid it collapsed under high presion .
I purchased this for my Honda Accord . It aligns TERRIBLY with the contour of my windshield and missing about 4-5 & # 34 ; of the windshield when wiping . I had a must more positive alignment experience with my truck , thus 2 stars instead of just 1 .
Cheap plastic that cracks easily and a waste of time.Get something that costs more and made better.the end
Have not used it yet but nice to have when needed . Thought this would help winterize if no RV antifreeze available .
Amazon provides a hard to find cleaning kit for the K & N auto air filters . Directions that come with the kit are a helpful reminder . There is enough Cleaner solvent and Oil for more than one cleaning . so it is an effective way to have clean filter for better fuel mileage w/o having to go out and find an OEM replacement
I purchased this product for my parents to use on a ceiling vent . They were pleased with the product overall . It was sturdy , easy to install , and serves the purpose of the purchase . They said the magnet held on well also .
I have an old car , Its bound to need these sometime . I got a set after I gave my old ones to my boss whose truck was acting up . These are long ( 20 ' ) and heavy duty feeling . Usually I 'm giving someone else a jump . If I ever have a bad experience with these I will come back and update the review .
You get what you pay for , and the price on these should be 0 ! Crack from the sun and discolor almost immediately ! Bought a new set by Adco , and the difference is night and day . The Adco products are a bit more money , but worth every penny !
Package arrived a bit ragged but it was all there , easy to install , takes less than 5 minutes , works as described . We used it on my F150 crew cab truck to haul my wife 's paddle board . Would suggest to anyone looking for a product like this .
It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks . I just do n't know , I may be doing something wrong . But , I do n't think so because I am following the directions on the package . If any one has some tips please post them ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
I bought this towel while looking for a cheaper alternative to my Cobra and Chemical Guys drying towels . The search goes on . I have washed this towel countless times and it still leaves blue fibers all over my car . It also is n't all that absorbent .
Good cleaner , really remove the dirt from my car seats and sofa . 1 star off for the flimsy bottle cap , broke when I try to tighten it harder .
While they are what they claim to be , you can go to your nearest hardware store and buy mch longer nails and a few washers for a lot less money .
this is a very nice stainless steel design . Mine was a bit longer than necessary so I put a few O-rings on the pin to keep it from rattling . The rubber cap covering the key hole could be a better design to fit more securely but I 'd buy it again .
I was expecting better tone that does not mean it do not do the job .. it does and does it pretty good but I used to have set of those black hella horns and I like that tone more than this one .. maybe it 's just matter of appreciation .. BTW others are half price of this ones ..
Really the best car duster out there in my opinion . Used others and they are cheap and fall apart easily . This one really gets the job done . Had it for almost two years now . Too bad I ca n't find where I put it : /
I bought this only to use the pump and it is great . I like it that the pump shows you the air pressure at the same time that you are putting air in the tire .
I have been using this for a while now , i like it , its a great nozzle , i can set it to whatever setting i want with ease . Does not leak while in use and it seems solid in my hands , i think this will last and ive dropped it a couple of times already . I think it works better with higher water pressure .
The one I received broke on the first torque adjustment . Went from base to 20 ft. lbs . and it made a grinding sound then locked up . Got it to move backwards , tried again ... no luck . Immediately sent back as defective .
This product removed several scratches from my car , only two were left . Mainly because they most likely too far into the car . But I also had paint from a cart or another car scrape onto mine , and it removed it completely . I was so excited . But I do wish it went a little further into the paint to remove the deep scratches .
While this is a simply plastic funnel , its uses are allot . My biggest use is with power equipment like my riding lawnmower ; the oil cap is near the bottom and a difficult place to fill . The funnel is perfect also for smaller engines like my Pressure Washer - etc . Hope this helps .
A little pricey , should have come with the cruiser plate cover . Bolted right on my 06 M3 , no need for the nuts .
I really wanted this to work , it 's exactly what I wanted . The massive tip on the end and the side spring design causes it to pop-out of my lighter socket.I liked the idea of the covers and it feels well built.Description should have said something about required socket depth ... I supposed it will work in a deeper socket , just not mine . Bummer .
I had bought a couple of these many years ago but recently bought a travel trailer so needed 4 more ( could only find one of my old ones ) . They are now dated for replacement . After buying these I found them at Walmart for $ 1.25 less per unit . The Walmart ones were dated a year later than the Amazon ones .
STOP ! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71 . It does NOT fit , no way , no how ! Get a 7/8 '' combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end ! My sensors were n't even that tight !
This product is very good but not great . It 's their consumer grade polishing glaze and their professional line is really great ! A good product at a very reasonable price .
These jack stands are awesome ... .very tall . My jeep has 4-5 inch of lift and is sitting on 35s . These stands have no problems holding it off the ground with lots of room to spare !
Thought I 'd find a use for this on both rear view mirrors , was mistaken . Still the convex surface allows for a really good viewing angle at a really cheap price so I have no complaints .
Be careful using this . It slipped off my jack while lifting the car causing the jack to dent the undercarriage .
I 've used this type of steering wheel cover ever since I can remember ! It takes time putting it on but it 's worth it ! Always get the & # 34 ; wide & # 34 ; version because any other type does n't cover the grip enough .
