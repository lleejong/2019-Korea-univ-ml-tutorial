These long cables work fine for my truck , but the quality seems a little on the shabby side . For the money I was not expecting 200 dollar snap-on jumper cables but these seem more like what you would see at a chinese knock off shop like harbor freight for 30 bucks .
They are rather small and really cheaply constructed i could have bought stuff at the store to build these cheaper they went with my old pop up trailer when i traded it in .
As soon as I plugged it in I heard a `` pop '' . No output . I guess try another inverter and probably another Cobra .
This is a small funnel , It will work for just abought any task.Small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean .
this is the cleaner and oil for kn , what more do you want ? finger will hurt after using the spray bottle , so pony up more for the regular hand sprayer or aerosol type or even put the cleaner in a hand sprayer yourself . Be innovative people..
I tried to get at the local auto parts stores , no on had in stock , thank you amazon , now my front plate and it does n't rattle any more
Noticed a big change after putting into the tranny . not the cheapest but who wants to break down on the road
Cheap , but huge ! Love it ! I will never have a vehicle without these again ! I highly recommend them . I 'm watching The Rock right now . I had to type 20 words .
Filter is one of the best , price is one of the worst in the market.When you can get one of these for 5.38 at KMart why would you even want to buy it from amazon ? I do not .
This is a common problem on all these sealers , the caps are horrible and they are basically one time use . The latest trick i have used is putting a clear wrap under the cap to help seal it but even so after time it hardens . The product itself works well and it costs a bit as you can tell compared to non cooper mix .
these work great and are easy to put on and take off ; I had to modify the lower clip to conform to the mirror on a F-150 but it was easy and I recommend these mirrows to anyone who has a pair of pliers and a little do-it-yourself tallent for the F-150 2012 model
I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue . Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work . Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg . to obtain return number . Then had to contact seller again . Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer . Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package .
Despite the item description , not compatible with 2009 Dodge SUVs which have canbus autolights . The harness did plug right into two different brands of HID kits , but did not stop the flickering at all .
These little things are really cool , so I would recommend them if you do n't mind drilling out your plate mounts . I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard .
Nothing wrong with the bulbs , but even at their sale price ( I think it was $ 16 or so ? ) they were a poor value . Not any brighter than the set that was in there ... just the cheapo kragen brand .
The cord is long enough for my Jeep , but may not be long enough for larger vehicles if used for a tire air compressor ( which is why I bought it ) . Seems to be fine , other then as I said the handles easily fall off . But for the price , it should work fine for occasional use .
This is the first time using a clay bar , very simple.Follow the instructions or look at the many videos on line.Quick and very easy to use and took less than 20 minutes
This the same as the door cover the velcro strips could be better . We bought this and the door cover the strips melt when it gets hot we went and got differents strips and work good ..but they tear easy..
I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed . I may use the other pieces at a later time , so this kit for the price was a great investment . Very hight quality .
The problem with this wash mop is that the head falls off the handle quite easily . If you try to shake it off to get some rinse water out the whole head pops right off . Obviously this is very annoying . And this problem occurred from day 1 it is not that the thing was abused over time .
This is a great quality - made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature , the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out .
I ordered a larger size as everyone said in their review to do , however this was so small I gave it to my son . If you wear a XL order a XXXL minimum , It may fit .
Will not buy again . Tooo small of amount and marginal performance .
These work well but mine are very BLUE , not white . They look kinda of white in the day light but very blue at night.UPDATE : These started to flicker after about two months of use . JUNK .
Not sure what all the 1 star reviewers are doing wrong as these dry my cars dry streak and spot free . You see some micro streaks when using this but they evaporate . Using the same two for over 15 years stored in their containers . No mold or anything ... best drying material I ever used and I tried them all .
These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use . Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out . Low grade product .
Ok , I get that there are bound to be some DOA bulbs . Could n't you just send a replacement without having to return the defective one ? It is n't going to be repaired , so just show the customer that you really want their business and not make them send it back in the mail . How much is it going to really cost you ?
The Honda dealer wanted over $ 1,000 to replace the back shocks on my S2000 . I bought these and a few tools totaling under a $ 100 and saved $ 500 by DIY . That makes these a winner.Mike
I have a full size sedan and this windshield cover was too small . It also tended to & # 34 ; ride up & # 34 ; the window and not keep the wipers covered .
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications . Can not recommend . The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it .
This stuff is a very good conditioner for your boots and other leather products . It was recommended to me by the local shoe repair guy . I 'm very happy with it . I would definitely buy it again . It does seem to last for a while .
This cover is a little bulky on the steering wheel . Fits nice and works great but I would have chosen a thinner cover if I knew . Other than that , I am happy with this cover .
I bought 2 pairs of these . 1 bulb is DOA . Too much hassle to return so I went ahead and bought another pair.For the price , eh , I ca n't really complain ...
First time I zipped pants leg the zipper broke off right in my hand lol now that 's quality . Buy something else !
Did n't last very long in the Florida sun . Not impressed with any of the Rain-X products . Would n't buy again . Prood that a good marketing plan can sell even an inferior product !
so this sat around for awhile before i used it and sure enough i go to use it and the top of the UNOPEN tube is hardened and unuse able this is BS and i cant even retuen it
I bought these mainly because they were cheap and sometimes passengers have difficulty climbing into my TJ , however once installed they looked totally ridiculous on the roll bars . They are huge , look very out of place . Quality of the product seems decent , its just the appearance of it on the vehicle I don`t like
i wouldnt buy again , doesnt last , take the time and do a good hand wax application , might be handy for a quik dusting , thatsd about it , dont use on interior as it eats away the lettering on handles/ etc
Once winter hit and the road salt got on the blades they began causing a LOT of smearing . I would highly recommend Rain-X Latitude but not this .
When I bought this product I thought `` great I wo n't need to bring heavy cinder blocks with me anymore . '' Well , I was wrong . The top is too narrow for my jack to go on safely . When I put the camper on it , it seems way to unstable .
NEEDS DRIVER AND SOFTWARE HELP WILL NOT INSTALL AUTO INSTALL DISC WONT DO NOTHING BUT TELL YOU WHAT IT WONT DO .
It is a waste of money for the intended purpose ! Got ripped purchasing this ! It might be a great product for some other purpose but not a Save-A-Step brace ! It is made ok , if I could find another purpose for it .
I bought this for the cig end , so I cut off the alligator clips . The clips seem a bit cheap , but the the cig end seems well made .
The kit makes cleaning the K & N filters so much easier and cuts through the grease and grime better then average soaps without leaving a residue behind .
I 've used it a few times now on problems areas on the car and it has no effect . I will try something else from a different brand .
The Walex TOI-61776 Elemonate Grey Water Deodorizer and Cleaner works ok , just ok for a few days and I have to place more in the Gray Water Tank . I wish there was a product on the market that would work alittle longer . But , you have to remember what your dealing with , & # 34 ; A rolling outhouse & # 34 ; ! !
I cant say this product worked on the two vehicles I tried it on . It made one vehicle worse than it was before I added it .
I use these to run a 12v air inflater that is 13 amps . and prevent blowing the fuse on the cigarette fuse . works well , heavier wire than others .
Well they work ! Easy to put on . Might not fit some ends that are not rounded . ( to bulky to slide in )
Do not purchase other brand recharger kits . They are inferior oils used with them . This kit is by far better than any other recharger kits out there .
Ok yes I know this should keep everything in place and tight but does n't look very tight and it has lots of play in it not my time
I got this kit never having used a lifetime air filter before and not sure what to think of it . Man , does it give you peace of mind to know you do n't have to find a new one every few months . Just pull it out , clean it , re-oil it and good to go .
I purchased this item for dusting on my Harley . It easily gets into hard to reach areas to keep them dust free . I also have used it for dusting in my automobile where it works well . I would recommend this product to all my friends . I do own the full sized California Duster for exterior dusting and the full size interior duster . They all work perfectly .
This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates . I 'm happy . It does n't fit all cars . Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight ! !
I knew it was n't for MY grease gun , but with some altering it will squeak by ... for $ 6 and free shipping ? It will hopefully work as good as the large hose clamp I previously used .
This stuff is expensive and you only get a small amount . Lets face it , 32oz is a medium soda . MOTHERS , please give us a little more for the $ , your product is great though . 4 stars for quality , loses the 5th for the amount you get for the $ .
This filter is cheaper over the long run that buying replacement paper filters . You will also enjoy better filtering and more airflow with this unit .
After reading reviews and opinions on other waxes , I just stuck with what I`ve used before and I`m not disappointed at all . I did however apply this wax with a buffer . After cutting the hull with Flitz , I followed through with Flagship premium wax and this 15 year hull looks incredible !
very easy to use and provide great protection and shine . I see no reason to use separate polish as I did a comparison and this alone provides same level of shine as using Meguairs # 7 polish . Plus this is a wax and provides protection .
I bought this product ( two cans ) a few weeks ago from another site and it is not what it claims to be.It left a white gummy residue on my tires and no shine . I eventually had to return one can .
I bought this to jack up my 4Runner . It is sturdy for 3 ton , but a little short for a SUV . So I have to be careful to be sure the chassis bar stay on the top of the jack stand when I lower the jack . Otherwise , it is very good .
Would not connect from my 2005 Dodge Ram Diesel to a Toshiba A100 or a Tmobile G2 with the Torque app .
For those who wants to purchase thi 45 degree turn stop . It will leak when there is a rush of waste water coming out . The seal from the hose can not handle this type of pressure . The 90 degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal .
Very cheaply made if you use your tailgate alot I would not recommend it does the job but do n't think it would hold up if used all the time .
If you want to get the most out of your towing lights harness or you truck harness you need these covers ... I will never again go without this product ... fit tight does n't fall off with road vibration ... Buy , Buy , Buy ...
Easy to hook up and nice and loud . I mount them on mobility power chairs and scooters since the original horns are not loud enough to hear from more then two feet away
If you need extra room for storing this , then is perfect for you ; ball sizes range from 1 7/8 to 2 1/2 '' and change very easily with little effort . This model requires a slight turn of the center pin to lock/unlock the ball for changing and you need to remember to re-lock it after attachment .
I do n't think KC 's look right unless they have these ... .so pick them up ! Easy snap on part , and they look even better if you spray them all black .
This product is pretty simple . Interior tube slides up and down , no spring return.Looks durable enough to take the abuse of being thrown around.Optional , removable pen-style clip is included .
For my Crown Vic , this was the only way to get to the adjustment screws and be able to turn them . Not much else to say , it 's the right tool for a specific job .
Does n't fit well at all . Every time you lift the console it comes off . Do n't waste your money or time trying to make it work .
Used this on a black Dodge Charger with clear coat and the sparkly paint.It did a good job of removing finger nail marks under the door handles and minor scratches where things were dragged over the back bumper to put them in the trunk.It did not harm the clear coat.I would buy this again .
When these are attached to the lynx levelling blocks the instant you hit it it pops off the block it 's attached to . So I guess it does let you know when you 're on the blocks , but it 's not confidence inspiring at all . Now sitting in the garage ignored .
Master Lock 262 DAT Chrome Lug Nut Style Spare Tire Lock is a simple to use and reasonable sturdy product . Good value
I did not see any difference even after applying for long time . It may work better on older paints ( but I doubt it ) . Does not even remove swirls , I was very attentive and applied for long time - no difference at all . Does nothing.I Do not recommend this one .
The pump seems to work fine . The flaws arise in the leaky reservoir and fittings . The only way for a vacuum pump to really work is to be able to create a seal . This thing leaks not only from the poorly designed reservoir , but from every tube connection point.I ended up going with the Motive pump for my Audi A4 instead . It costs more but its actually usable .
Thia says 500lb capacity , maybe right over the main support , but otherwise you should balance your load well and I will use straps to help support the outboard corners . I kept it because it is a usefull thing , but not for a heavy items .
Cheap and thin . Fit ok but was worried it would either rip in the wind or blow off the spare so I returned it . Painless return process from Amazon , 5 stars for that , anyway .
the bag it came with dosent fit it , if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting , this does exactley what they say , seems pretty rugged , it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob .
supposed to slip in.. well you got ta smash it in and am scared to try it with my trailer hitch lights. wan na see if I can return it
After only a few days , my 26 '' wiper developed a large area that it would not wipe , so I had to buy a new wiper . Since it may be due to getting a `` bad one '' and since the smaller wiper seems to work better , I 'll give it two stars instead of just one .
Great ... ...
Does not work with late model Dodge canbus autolights . The styrofoam packaging inside the case was damaged upon arrival , but the parts themselves were not visibly damaged .
This was my first clay bar kit and I have to say it 's very effective and easy to use . The microfiber towel they provide is not the best of quality or else I 'd give it 5 stars . Overall , it 's an excellent product and I would n't hesitate to purchase again .
I wanted to like this but all it did was squeak and bounce across the glass and the car surface , leaving the water behind . It was useless .
We were in need of replacement awning pull strap and figured this would be a good brand.No problems with the length or the strap , the t slider piece however could be a little stifferand thicker to give a solid feel . As it it does work fine I just worry that the strap willpull out of the awning slot .
This air deflector was installed beneath our chest of drawers in the bedroom and is successful at getting the air stream into the main bedroom more quickly . The fact that it can be expanded to cover our 12 & # 34 ; wide vents is a plus .
I needed it , so I had to buy it I elt it could had been cheaper but it got the job done .
Good day to all This is good for conditioning . But not for cleaning though . I was looking fot this to clean as well . but it failed in that . But it did condition it though . The other Meguiar 's have done the job . But tis one slipped a bit . I know I can fine what I am looking for through them though .
Upon all the Led light bulbs i 've been buying , this proves to be the most reliable . It has a very strong light penetration and lasts long . Though it breaks easily if not handled properly . Two of mine got broken while trying to insert them in their positions
well this stuff works . i had some gunk clogging up my fram airhog filter so i used this k & n stuff . had to let it sit for a good 10-15 minutes twice . now my FRAM filter is good as new . by the way , the fram air-hog is a washable filter .
Overall , there is nothing wrong with this brush , but it just does n't seem to clean . I have a 2012 for explorer and this brush just does n't seem to do anything between the spokes .
Well At least Ive never heard that before but I will say it about this product . The jack was unabable to lift my car high enough for the 2 ton jacks reccomended along with this product . So unless you have a dam even driveway get a jack that can lift a little bit higher .
this is a nice piece of equipment and it is a must have for an RV water system but i found out very quickly that i was switching compressor hoses constantly because this wasnt the same size as my air tools , yeah you can change those nipples out but honestly , just use the valve stem style blow out and you wont have any problem .
I 've been using these hose nozzles for years , you wo n't find a better nozzle anywhere . Do n't hesitate , buy a few you will love them .
This is a great wax . I live in Chicago so weather can be kind of crazy . This wax lasts about 3 washes for me until I need to reapply more .
It is what it is . I have tried a few different brands and have yet to discern a difference . I buy whatever is cheapest at the time . This worked well while I had it . I did notice it sticks a bit more than some others I have tried . Not enough for me to avoid it in the future if it is on sale .
I really thought these blades would be awesome replacements for my OEM 's , I was wrong . They do not form to the window and they leave streaks right in the eye line of the windshield . I 'm definitely going to replace them soon , but will not be buying Rain X ever again .
i tried to wipe it off as in the instructions , and the surface was cool , it left large black circles on hood , did n't go away with regular washing , went away with waterless foamtek only ! ! ! ! !
We 've set this up 3 times since we left on our trip April 27th . Today , the 3rd time hooking it up , the elbow completely separated from the hose . Now with about 1/2 roll of duct tape holding it on it 's still dripping . Flimsy , there are others out there worth the $ $ $ This is n't !
I 've used this on two cars and I 'm not sure it 's actually better than the soap and water wash I gave the tires and wheels before applying . It just seems like fancy spray bottle of soap .
Like the shine so far , will see how long it lasts , one week so far and water is still beading off the car
Used a quick connect to use with my existing Husky compressor . Very easy to use and easy to ready . It 's very sturdy , and I have no concerns about it falling and taking a little abuse over the next few years .
Does the job well . Comes with easy to understand instructions.Takes less than half an hour to do the job .
Kit comes with cleaning spray and recharger oil . Easy instructions . It just takes time and patience for the filter to dry after washing . You also need to plan ahead or drop a temporary air filter in your car in the time being when you are re-oiling your filter .
The adhesive to these is HORRIBLE ! ! I use them for room darkening in our RV when camping and I was constantly having to put the back up because the adhesive does not stick well . For room darkening however THEY ARE GREAT !
Got this to keep my lawn mower maintained . I keep it outside most the year , and was surprised to read that this product is NOT intended for outdoor use . Called the company and they explained this product is designed to be used inside a vehicle . Kind of defeats the purpose of this product .
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows . This does the job quite nicely . It is n't how well it does , rather how safely it does it .
These mirrors are the best that I have found for towing a travel trailer . They are easily installed and they do not vibrate at all . The field of view is goodsnd When not towing a trailer , they are easily removed for storage .
Nothing special , i just got it and it works . Will post in the future if any problems occur or if it holds up well .
